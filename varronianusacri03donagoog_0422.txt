exaotly to apud, takes different esses according ιο the meaning
implied by the special reference (Gr. Gr. Art 485). In low
latin we heve the componud οό-αηιο from which comes the
French aeaut, aud even de-ab-aute, from whence eomes decent
(see Pott, Zeitscdr. fl d. Veryl. Sprf. 1. p. 311).

The preposition iu has also the comparative forms irs-ter and
irc-tra, or sir-fre, which imply motion, and are consequendy
joined to the accusative. The sume is the case with (ιη-ιε,
which retains the a found in arr-tar, Senem. ιιι-ιον, Gr. ἆ-τερ
for ἅν-τερ (Neu Oret. ξ 204). Iu meaning cru-ta corresponds
to the Greek ‹iv-ri only so far as the latter signifies “in hunt
of,” which is the primitive signification of the Latin particle.
The Greek πρό, from whence comes πρός, or προτί, claime a
common origin with pro,· aud there can be no doubt aa to the
connexion between παρά, whence παροί, and me,- but there are
many shsdes of meaning in which the Latin and Greek terme by
no means coincide. Ite-ter, which isa comparative ol prm, and
prop-ter, which is similarly formed from pro-pe, an extension of
pro (above, §5), erpress exsctly certain meanings of uepd: thus
παρὰ δόξαν =prmter opinionon, and παρὰ ταῦτα =propter s'stu.
Per exactly auswers to παρά, in its 'negative or depreciating
sense, in componnds such as pejero for perficere = παρορκέοε cf.
pejor for perier. Although per and περί are identicul words,
there cre only some few cases in which their significatione
strictly eomespoud (see Neu Orat. ἐξ 177, 8). Itis perhaps
still more difficult ιο show the exact relation in meaning be·
tween the Greek aud Latin affix -περ, per: ct ὅπερ, ὅσαπερ,
dcc. with poullhper, nuper, dre. In many of its employments
the Latin per coincides exactly with the Greek διά, which, with
the genitive, end, iu the older poete, with the accusative also,
signifies “ through,” aud which, with the accusative iu ordinary
Greek, corresponds ιο the use of παρά, propter, to which I have
just adverted. Etymologically there ean be no doubt that διά
finds a representative iu the latin de, which implies deseent
and derivatiou, and isos course used with the ablative. In
form ds corresponds to the old Latin se for siue, sudas the
tull form of this se was sed, or set, we find in Oscan (above,
p. 144) that de oriffl'nelly appeared us dat. It has been remarked
already, that ah differs from eu, the other proposition most di·
