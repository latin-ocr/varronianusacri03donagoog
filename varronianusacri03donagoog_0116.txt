earliest and certainly the most permanently influential clement
in the old languages ol Italy, we should expect to find iu these
languages those characteristica of Sclavonism which evince the
primitive contact and actual contrast os the Semitic and Sclavo·
nian idioma. And this expectation is amply justified by the facts
of the case. For while, on the one hand, we observa in the old
Latin, Umbrian, and Oscan, verbal resemblances to the Semitic,
which cannot be accidental, because they belong to some of the
oldest forms iu the respective languages3 and while both the
Semitic aud theold Italian are remarkable, like the Sclavoniau,
sor their superabundance of sibilante, we observe that in spite of
the cultivation of Greek literature by the Romans, aud in spite
os the adoption of the Greek ritual by the Sclavonians, these lan-
guages have neverattaiued to the use of a definite article, which
is the hey-stone of Greek syntax, and without which the Semitic
lauguages could not construet a single sentence. The prepon-
derance of the sibilante in the old Italian languages will be dis·
cnssed in the next Chapter, and we shall see in the proper place
that in calcat, or as an initial, the a always appears in Latin
where it is omitted altogether, or represented only by an aspi-
rate in Greek. Of the coincidences between the pure Latin
and genuine Semitic words, it will he sufficient to give a lev
examples out of many which might be adduced. (a) The verb

aveo or dccco is at least aa closely connected with 21¹]ss or ”ll l

as with any Indo-Germanic synonym. (b) The words recurris
end art-pitto have occasioned great difficulty to philologers. The
former, according to Bopp (Verql. Gr. p. 1097), is a participial
noun from seco, aud cadmiae-craia must be compared with the
Senserit forms iu -aslrt=Gr. -υῖα, This however is hardly more
than a conjecture, for we have no other Latin noun to support
the analogy. It is more probablc that the initial syllable iu
both words is one of those prepositional affixos which we find iu
c-atrrapvcu compared with κόπτω, s-ponta compared with pondus,
cc, and then we shall bc able to see the resemblance between st-

curr‘s and the Hebrew Ιῃξ, Lett. praest “ to heck or gnaw,’¹ aud
between sagitta and the Hebrew tt] from Υξζῐ, which again is
