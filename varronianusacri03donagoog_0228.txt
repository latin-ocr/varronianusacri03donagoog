A collection of these inscriptions has been made by Lanni (Sapyio,
11. p. 319, Epitofl acciti fra’ pia antichi, no. 188-200)¹; and
Mulier thinks (Etraak. 1. p. 451) that they are all pure Pelas-
gian. Some of them, indeed, seem to he almost Greek-at least,
they are more nearly ukin to Greek thau to Latin. Take, for
instance, uo. 191, which has been adduced both by Mttller and

by Iepaius, and which runs thus:
M i lccloiru suita.
Surely 'this is little else than archaia Greek: εἰμὶ Kampoi

, fatte In regard to the last word at any rate, even modern

Latin approaches more nearly to the Etruscan type. It is well
known that the terminatiou -al, -nl in Etruscan indicates a
patronymic. Thus a figure 01 Apollo, found in Picenum, is iu-
scribed, ‚Iapeti-at Epare, i. e. “Jupiter's son, Apollo.” The
syllable -al corresponds to the Latin form olis, but in its sig·
nificance as a patronymic it ia represented rather by attae, as
in Serota, &vilius ; Ladae [hemlion dcc. According to this
analogy, filins, from fio, is nearer to the Etruscan than φυιός,
hom the AEolic φυίω (Et, M. p. 254, 16).

There is another inscription of this class which deterres
particular notice, because, though it is singularly like Greek, it
contains two words which are of constant occurrence iu the least
Pelasgian of the Etruscan monuments, and furnish us with the
strongest evidence of the Low-German or Scandinavian affinities
of a portion at least oi the Etruscan language. A bronze figure,
representing Apollo crowned with laurel (Gori, Mae. Etruac. 1.
pl. 32), has the following inscription:

M i phlercc epol opha antimi
placati taphrae turca olen ceco.

¹ There ia also an old inscription in the vatican Library which belongs
to the same class: rai Vanam flacceaar, which Mommsen would rander

(Umera'tat. 1110101100, p. 18): ram Veneria Erycinae. He hoa mentioned some
others of the rama kind.
