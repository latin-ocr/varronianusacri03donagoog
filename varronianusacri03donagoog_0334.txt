genitive3 and similarly tubi-conju] makes tadi-eima Another
change from 1t0 n is to ba remarked in the uanslcrmstion of
the diphthongs ΔΙ, 01 into ssand os. It was elac a peculiarityot'
the Latin writers from the earliest times to use u as s repre-
sentative of er, for which also they occssionally substituted 1.
Thus, while ’'Hwespoe becomes Ept‘tw Dei,Dt,· Deris, Dia-&c ;

, tres by the side of trech Schwartse (alte AEyypteu 1. p. 605)
distinguishes three main pericds of Latin orthography in regard
tc the pmnunciatiou of 1 sud u. The peculiarity of the first
end oldest period consisted in the employment ot* u with a dull
1 mund, which Schwartze terms the epinyctis. The second
period, which immediately preceded the classiml, wrotel instead

of this epinyctis. The third or classical period in accnsiderable ¹

number of forms introduced au s, which formally corresponded
to the old n paispuis, hut was motertblly different from it, and
this, aa it possessed the true sound of u, he calls the phcnctic s.

’ It is worthy of remark that as Ennius introduced the custom
ol doubling the mutes, semivcwels, and liquide for the purpose
of expressing the shsrp sound which they sometimes threw back

on the preceding vowel (Festus, p. 293), and as a substitute for i

the εἱοίἰίοω or invented c, which was also used for the same pur·
pose, as in sal'a, acr⁹c, as'cres (Mar. Victor. p. 2456), so also the
tragedian'Attius introduced double vowels lor the purpose of iu-
dicating that the syllable was long by nature (Vel. Ircng. p. 2220),
a practice which is observed iu inscriptions from the time of

the Gracchi up tc (licerc’s consulship (Rimul, de Vocatus ³

Gemiuotsb ab Attio Grammatico, cited by Corssen, 1. p. 8). Thus

‘they wrote Fatis, leuce, pepuhatau, jusso, dsc. In order, how· i

ever, to mark adouble ι, they sometimes wrote ΕΙ as in usui, ·
and sometimes used a large single letter, as in fclicl. fleat, th,

dec. The Romans seemlto harahad a special obiection tc the ³

double 11, and used raucus substitutas for it. Sometimes we

have nt where the form of the word ought to have given 11, us in y

oli-enus for ali-inus, vari-epure for vari-iqare or oar-tyara (ct'.
humare, sumtum). Sometimes a simple ‘long 1 is found instead
ofu10r113 thus s'i, tu, dii, dte, do not appear in the best ages

of the lauguage3 but we have either si, cia, dei, det, or ἰ, te, dt, χ
