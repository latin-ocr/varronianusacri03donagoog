latter is a longer form than capro ; but this implies that cupio
wyri-po, which is in accordance with the theory respecting the
ἰ· verbs. In all other verbs, however, which form the present in
-a'o and the infinitive in ere, it is plain that there is only one
affection of the root with a formative appendage‚ and the nature
of this adjunct is clearly seen in the case offup-co. For there
can be no doubt that we have here the root fiac, and that
the same root is found in φεύγω, aor. &dury-ov, where it is
shcngthencd by paca (Now Orat. ξ 442), and in deved-uo,
where it is not only strengthened by camora, but supported
by an additional nasal (ibid. ξ 435). To the same class as φυγ-
γάνω we must refer tlrc deponent foa-por, “I make myself
quit of‚“ “get fairly away from‚” “discharge” or “ perform.''
And from a comparison of these cognate verbs with flagi-ac, we
sec that it is affected only with a single formative adjunct, which
is the same as that which is assimilated in the Greek ψάλλω,
and transferred to the root-syllable in φθείρω, root deep,
φαίνω, root da, κρῑνω, root apt· (Nero Orat. §432). With ro·
gard to the a· verbs, the known derivation of many of them, and
the termination of the participle (Ε. ΙΙΙ.) in -a'ttas orcitus, shows
that they areabridgments ordegenerate forms of e-verbs. Thus it
is clear that metu-0 comes from meta-e, tribea-o from triba-a, duc. ;
and as the verbs are thus connected with crude forms of the semi·
consonantal declensions, they require in addition another pro-
nominal adjunct, and thus stand in the same relation to the
geuuinesemi·consonant verbs in -α, such as rao, ruere, cattus, that
the vowel tverbs bearto thesemiwnsonantal verbs in i. As the
iis after all a representative of some guttmal‚ those apparently
a· verbsswhich exhibit their guttur-al characteristic in the perfect,
as erno, maci, stratores, do not essentially differ from those,
which, like meum, hare absorbed the clement pc.

From the formatione, which we have just discussed, and in
which the. second elem'ent, under the modification i=ya‚ plays
so prominent a part, there is on immediate transition to the
first class of the so·called irregular verbs, which strengthen the
present by the addition of one or more actual consonante. As
far ss the epithet “ irregular” is concamed, we have seen that
