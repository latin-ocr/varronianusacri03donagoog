in the perfecte of thie conjugation, is to assume that iu the rna-

jority cl instances it was merely one of those adjunets, which are

used for the purpose ol strengthening the present and the tensoe ,

derived from it. Among these adjuncts not the least common is

the second clement under the form ya (see Nero Orat. §wli

432), and as thie is 'clearly contained in many Greek verbs in i

-εω which are also written -ιω (Nero Orat. §432 ry), so there
l

are many special reasons sor inserting the presence of this auxi-
liary in the Latin verbs in -eu Perhaps the most important of
these special reasons is suggested hy the phenomenon that many
active verbs in Latin, either (a) uncontracted, or (b) contracted
in -a, have a neuter or passive verb from the same root distin·
guisbed by the formative characteristic e; thus we bave (a) active
piscare, passive jecere ,· active paudere, passive patera· active pea-
dtrc, passive pendere· active scandere, passive scotera· (b) active
le’qudrc, passive lr'quercr active partire, pcre'ra passive parere ,·
active sedive, passive sedere. Now it is well known that the in-
sertion of ya between the root and the ending forms the pas·
sive voice in Senserit in the conjug. tenses (Neu Orat. § 379), and
Ι have shown (thid. §381) that a similar explanation is applicable
to the Greek passive aorists in -θην and -ην; and as one of these
aorists ie icmv=dordyapa we may conclude that the irre·
gular ethre, which is opposed to sistere, stands for etc-yere or
atah-gere (above, p. 442), and in the same way we shall bring
back to this conjugation firqdrc, which is similarly opposed to
figora. The next section will pointout the distinction between
these verbs fomred with the pronominal μα, and those which
have tbe verb co, as an auxiliary accretion. With regard to
those now under consideration, as in the case of the subordinate
verb-forms in Hebrew, it depende upon the nature of the primary
clement whether the verb is intransitive, as in the instances just
adduped, or causative, intensive, or frequentative, aa in others
which'might be cited. Thus moa-eo, which contains tharnet
mea- implying thought and recollection (manib-i, dte), bearna
causative meaning. Hiar-eo, like the Greek αἱρ-ἐω, is an in-
tensive form ol a root not unconnected with the Latin hir, “a
hand;” Umbrian here, “to take·;'' Senserit, hri=cupcrc (see
above, pp. 111, 118). The substantive hoerea or heres (hier-effi
haerccd, above, p. 146) is connected with this verb, iu the
