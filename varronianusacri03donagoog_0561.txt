The difference between the modern Italian, considered ee the
offspring of the new Tuscen literature, and the old French,
regarded as a scionof the Roman language‚ which was spoken in
the province of Gaul, consiste in the fact to which 1 heve already

· adverted-namely, that the former would reproduce the mincing ,
end pedantio pronunciation ,of the literary Romans, while the
latter would retain the genuine colloquial utterance of the hcc
colonists of the empire. It is worthy of observation that the
French langnage itself eneblee us to incenato this difference. If
wc examine the Frcnch languege as it is, we shall often find
double forms of derivativcs from thc Latin. Now in every one
of these cases it is remarkable that the older word-that which
belongs to tho oldest end most geum vocabulary-differs most
from the written form or syllable pronunciation of the Latin
original. Thus danaim, edetis, cta, odore, britel, nois, Noel,
ffipouceer, from cananaeus, captivus, coeo, coneo, torpes ac·
tices, actalia, pe'ctoe, copolearc, are older forms than cancrique,
captis, coac, cauce, ldpitcl, notice, nctol, patro, apuleo. (See
A. W. Schlegel‚ Obseroaa'ooe eur lc Imque ct le Idttbraturc ,

written, the former from the spoken language.
