however, before concluding this pert oi the subject, to make a
few remarks ou the Fabulae Atellano, the only hranch of Oscan
literature of which we know anything.

- The most important passage respecting the Fatue Ael- ,

loom ,'—thet ιιι whieh Livy rs speaking (vll. 2) oi the introduc·
tion of the Tusean ludiones at Rome' m the year ΔΜ. 390,-
has often been misunderstood3 and the sams has been the fata
of a pmsage in Tacitus (lv. 14), in which the historiau mentions
the expulsion of the actore from Italy in the year s. luc. 776.
With regard to the latter, Tacitus has caused some confusion
by his inaccurate use os the word lesan· but Suetonius hes
the phrase Atellanarum dbm‘o (Nero, c. 39); and the word had
either lost its earlier and more limited signification, or the Atel·
laum were then performed byreguler tamenn. .

Livy says that, among other means of appensing the anger of

the gods in the pestilenee of 390 Δ. 11. c., scenic gemes were for
the first time introduced st Rome. Hitherto the Romans had

no public sports except those of the circus-uamely, races and
wrestling;⁴ but now this trivial and foreign amusement was
introduced. Etruscan ludiones dsnced graecfirlly to the sound
of the duta without any accompaniment of words, eud without
any professed mimic action. Asterwards, the Roman youth
began to imitate these danem, and accompanied them with unpre·
meditetcd jests, at'ter the manner of the Fescennina verses3 these
effusione gave way to the saturo, written in verse and set to the
flute, which was acted hy professori histriones with suitshle sengs
aud gesturcs3 and then, after a lapse of several years, Livius
Andronicus rentured to convert the soemo into a regular poem, Ι
and to make s distinction between the singing (canthum) and

the dialogus (diverbia), the letter alone being reserved to the
inituim, and the former being a monologue‚ by way of inter·
lude, with a flutc accompenimentl. Upon this, the Roman youth,

leaving the regular play to the prefessed actors, revired the old

¹Diomod m. p. 4892 “iu canticis una tantum debetores persona,
ant, ιί duce fuerint, its debent esee, ut ex occulto una audiat, nec eollo·
quatur, sed secum, si opus fuerit, rerba faeiat.” On the comicum see

Hermann, Opere. r. pp. 290, sqq, who has clearly shown that it was not
merely a bute voluntary between the acts. ·
