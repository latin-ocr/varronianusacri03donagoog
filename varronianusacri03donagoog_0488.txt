υἷε-υἱ. A conclusive proof of the truth of this·theory is furnished ἢ
by the adjective lentus, for it contains both the assumed primary 3
meaning of li-no, and its common secondary signification. The l
form shows that it is an elongated participle, and while we have p
opo-lenna, emeatus, dte, we have also opu-bam, oa’clena, dre. ³

And it is to be observed that, with the exception of naci-tenua
this class of adjectivae has ὅ or a instead of the usual l as the
vowel of connexion3 thus we' have trasco-leatus, vira-omas, dre.
This peculimty points to ‘the form of the involved derivative
verb. For as valeus, violentus stand by the side of υἰοῑυ, so
opulens, opulentas, malentes, duc, are in analogy with such
verbs as pulla-lo, lueto, postu-lo, neoti-lo, &a If these adjec-
tives in -leutua are derived from verbs in -lo‚ we should infer
from the case of nubieus that the meaning of the participle is
active; but, standing by itself leutos seems to bear a passive
signification. F or its first meaning is “laid down '¹ or “ lyiug

down‚'‘ as lentus iu amora (Verg. Bae. 1. 4); hence it denotas ¹

“sluggish” or “heavy‚” and this is its meaning in the com-

ponnds just mentioned3 thenit signifies adhesive; and finally ¹

it implies that which is pliant‚ ie. that which yields without
breaking. Now all these menningo of the participle lano arc
implied or included in leo, loo, or li-roo,· and thus we can have

no doubt as to the meaning of the verb. It has been mentioned l
already (p. 221), that the solitary form ae-ro, A. III. εέ-υἰ, as l

distinguished from aer-o, samaa] is merely a modification of carso,

ἐί-ιη’. This is susceptible of a very easy proof. nor the form ’

of the perfect shows that r is an adjunct3 and in the pronominal
affixas r is only a form of o. Consequently there is only the

same differenoe between ciazo, si-oi,· sero, aava} as between χ

temper-im and the later temper-em. The root of each is si- or
aa, which bears the same relation to “ set‚'' that “ lay'’ does to

“let'' or the tao, leo, just examined, to the Scandinavian lota. r

Se-ro, O. N. io or ada, Goth. sorbo, O. H. G. saon, N. H. G.

aden, Eng. “sora'’ merely means to set in the ground. And

the more·original form oi-oo denotes leaving or setting down ³

in general And the first application is in the sense of leaving a
thing alono or letting it be, as in the German dos Fauer auspebau
hasen our “to let the fire go out.’' Hence comes the ides of
allowing or suffering to be donc—and· finally the causative
