dtr. And the genitive in -1'2', exceptio adjectivee, ie generally
written -i iu the beet authore of the Augnetan age. This rule ie
applied aleo to the ooncurrencee of j and ἰ, and we find in the
beet MSS. not affecti), injicio, rcjfcrb‚ prrjr'ofo, dre„ but αᾱίοὼ, .
riticio, rer'crb, proicio, dre. (Coronen, 1. p. 312). The j ie retained
es a distinct consonant both before end after other vowele 3 thue
we have αιῇαηρο, ajuro, q’ectue, projectae, and it allowe the pre-
ceding vowel to romain short in btjaqm, trtjuqae, qaadrtjnqan
altijuyue. It ie remarkable that the only i verbe which regularly
have thom for rebam in the imperfect are tboee which change
εἰ· into r'e or a in the present, hemely, eo for ι’·ὡ, queo for qai-ab,
oio or σι’-ω for ci-r'o.

The vowel ο hae hed a curicus daetiny iu the growtlr and
decline of the Latin language. Up to the time of the Syrien
wer it retained its ploce, like the Greek 0, ae a formative letter.
Thus we have humber, quom, fonroone, avom, dre. in the earlier
period; but Medum, quum or cum, Quorum, anum, &c during
the literary epoch. Then again in the Italian theee u’e are
turned into οέ, ae in harh, incoquito, and the lilre (ree Ocreeen,
1. p. 298). Even the weaker vowele 1 and rr have iri many careo
excluded an original ο. Thue we have elle, illim and itte for
ollae, olim, eud obers and ento, colim, corre, corto, meter, are
regularly written ceto, celim, verro, verto, certer. Iu eecondary
formatione ο retains ite place to the end in coutraet to Α, rr and
13 thoe we have (floresco, 1. pp. 234, tom:
