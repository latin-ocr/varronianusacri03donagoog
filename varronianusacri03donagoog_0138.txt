Iateroerea (cf. Interamna). The epithet Frisios indicates that
the mountain was dedicated to the god Fabius or Frirovius
Sarrda‘us (Fadius Sancus), a name under which the old Italians
worshipped Jupiter in their mountain-temples. Lassen (p. 388)

idem Agnbio,” where Iguvium is obviously referred to. Lepsios
thinks that ocreis Fusus was the citadel of Iguvium.
Tota-per (tuta-per) Ileuor'na, “for the city ol Iguvium.”
It was always understood by previous interpretare that tuta or
toto was nothing more than the fem. of the Lat. tohu. But
Iepsius has clearly proved that it is both en Osoan and an
Umbrian substantive, signifying “city,” from which the adj.

¹ autem is derived, as in the neme of the magistrate madae l

tuticus, ie. moal urbanus: consequently tuta-per 'Ibam‘na is
simply “pro arbe Ipuoino.'' This substantive, totu or tuta, ie,

is that of “salossa” “collection” ‘⁴ entirely.” Similarly, the
Greek πόλις must contain thev root πολ· (non-ds) or πλε- ,
(πλέος), signifying the aggregation of the inhabitants in one
spot. The derivation of the adjective td-tus is by no means
easy. If we compare it with inst-ras (from velle), we may be
disposed to connect it with the root of the words tellus, tol-lo,

will take care not to confuse between this to-tas and the re·
duplicated form tlt-tus (comp. to-t·, qud-tas, doe), which is suffi-
ciently distinguished from it in the line of Lucretius (vl. 652):
