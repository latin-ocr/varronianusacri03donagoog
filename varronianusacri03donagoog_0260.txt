pared with pissima for plurima (Fosi. p. 205), scripulum sor
scrupalum, dre. (sce below, § 5). Salis is the original form of
solis: comp. σέλας, ἥλιος, Ars-sclina, dcc. The Oscan and Etrus-
can usage of the auxiliary ta or tu, “to canse’' (above, pp. 150,
154, 221), shows that Dltderlein is right iu reading ta=da in·

stead oi sta (Lat. Syn. u. Et. vl. 330). He quotes Hor.' 1. Ep. κ
16, 60: “da mihi fallere, da justo sanctumque videri,’' though ¹

he perceives that ta is connected with τίθημι rather than with
dadum. Berbcr is another form effervere.
4. manech is umacus, i. e. sanllemonss. Advocaps‘t is a

contractiori ior ud vos capric-the c being omitted, aa in duc, faa,

fer, dae—and it is probable that the phrase is equivalent to

utura a'a usualium, “ call to your aid.” Hermann (Elem. Doct.
Meu. p. 612 sq.) supposes advocapit to he jam duc capit.

'Phe other extant religione compositione, though few and
scanty, contribute to the same conclusion-that the oldest Latin
'was not so nnlike the langnage with which we are familiar as
to dely interpretation. Two relics of the same kind aa the last
have been preserved by Cato (R. Il. 160), who writes thus:
“Luxum siquod est, hac cantione sanum fist. Harundinsm
prende tibi viridem P. 1v. aut v. longam. Mediam diffinde, et
duo homines teneant ad coxendices. Incipe cantare in alio:
S[anum] F[iet]. In mota et solnta (vulg. mota voeto): durau
dardars'cs mutamus, dic sempiterno (vulg. dusaaapc'tcr or du
aaa pariter) usquedum coeant....Ad luxum aut ad fracturam

, alliga, sanum het, ettamen quotidie canuto in alio: S. F. vel

luxato: vel hoc modo: λαυαι, hasal, lavat: istc pasta susm:
dumabo domnapetra at lauat0,” i. e. haveat, hamat, haveat:
istam pestem summ: dmnabo damna uestra st lasarum (see
Grotefend‚ llud. L. Umdr. 1v. 13). With regard to the second .
mutatio, whichis simple enough, it is only necessary to ob-
serve, that the final m is omitted both in the accusatives lucrato,
pista, &c and in the future schta5 and we are especially told
that it was the custom with Cato the Censor to drop the m at
the terminatiou of the futures of verbs in -o and -ior thus he
' wrote due, sacac, for dieuco, faciam (see Quintil. Iust. Or. 1. 7,
§23, and cf. 1x. 4, § 393 Fest. p. 72, Muli), reapse for reci-
