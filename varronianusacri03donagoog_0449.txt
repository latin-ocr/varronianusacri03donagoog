σθένους obicem. In the fourth case: (a) ei anteve, ιῖιόννννν
=ei ἠπιστάμην, ἔλεγον ἄν. (b) ei volume plura, non ne·
ynam = ei πλεόνων ἐπεθύμησα, οὐκ ἂν ἠρνήσω. And this
confusion becomes menter still, when, by a rhetorical figure, the '
einporeible is supposed γνώω aa in Ter. Andr. ιι. 1, 10: ta
ai bio aab, cla'ter contains For in this instance the only differ·
enee between the two casea which is one of tense, is overlooked.
In the epodosis of ease 4, b, the Romans sometimes used the
plusquam-perfectum of the indicative, aa in Seneca, de Ira, 1. 11:
perulerat impertitur, ei Faetus tuntum ausae earet, quantum ἱνα
madum and Horace, 11. Cam. 17, 27: me 'truncae albrpem
cerebro mmlcrct, κάπ’ Faunae ictum deutra kvueaet Sometimes
the perfect was used in this apodosis‚ es in Juvenal, x. 123:
Antoni ’ plcadeba potuit wraoemnere, ai eie ornain debre‘eectr or
even the imperfect, aa in Tacitus, Annal. ΧΗ. 39: neo sileo
sapam nitebat, ni Ιῳὼννν papncm wcepebeent. Again, particles .
of time, like dom require the subjunctive when futura time is
spoken of; as in Hor. 1. Epist. 20, 10: carue eris Romoe, dorm
te deamat oetua. But this becomes a past tense of the indicative
when past time is referred to; as in Hor. 1. sphi. 10, 36:
oermra equam-pellabct-donoe [mnne] imploravit opes bominis
frenumque recepit. Theconfusion between the Latin indicative
and subjunctive is also shown by the use of the subjunctive pre·
sent aa a future indicative (a phenomenon equally remarkable in
Greek, Nem Orat. ξ 393), and conversely by the employment
of the periphrastic future (which ia, after all, the same kind
of form aa the ordinary composite form of the future indicative)
as an equivalent for a tense of the subjunctive mood. Thus
Cicero uses dabam aud diem instituo in the same construction;
Pttt. 1. 1: “cnoeqcam de republica dicam ea, quae dicenda hoc
tempore arbitror, exponam breviter consilium profectionis meae.''
Pro Muraena, l: “onteaqnam pro L. Murena daem instituo,
pro me ipso pauca dicam.” And we have always the indica-
tive in apodosie to the subjunctive when the future in ·rne
is med: e. g. Liv. xxxv111.47: “si tribuni prohiberent, testes
citaturus Μ’ (for “citerna”); and Cic. Verr. 111. 52: “illi
ipsi aratores, qui remanserant, relicturi omnes agros erenf'
(for “reliqnhmnt’j, “ nisi ad eoa Metellus Roma literas mi·
sisset.” The Romans also used the perfect subjunctive exactly
