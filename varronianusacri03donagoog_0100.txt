1f it is necessary to go one step farther, and identily this
Lithuanian racc with some one of the tribes which form so many

links ol the chain between Media and Thrace, it would be only
reasonable to select the Sauromace, whose name receives its in-

terpretation from the Lithuanian language (Securo-Meteri, i. e. ἶ
“Northern Medes'‘). The Sauromata and the Scytha were l

undoubtedly kindred tribes3 but still there were some marked

differences between them, insomnch that Herodotus reckons the ξ
Sarmata as a separate nation. Between the Pelasgians and the t
Umbrians, &e there existed the same affinities‚ with similar dif- ,

ferenoes3 and the fairest conclusion seems to be this, that aa the

Latine or Lithuanians were a combination of Gothic and Sclave-

nien ingrediente, so were the Sauromatae; that as the indigenons
tribes of Italy were pure Gothic, mixed with Celtic, so were the
Scythae or AsaGoths. At the same time it must be remarked,
that the term Sarmatian has a wider as well aa a narrower signi-
fication. In its more extended meaning it is synonymous with
Selavonian, and therefore includes the Pelasgians. In its nar·
rower nse, it is expressive of that admixture of Sclavenian and
Low-German clemente which characterines the Lithuanian or
Samo-Getic langnrgm, and in which the Sclavonian is so predo-
minant that the Gothic clement is almost overpowered. Revert-
ing to the Asiatie settlements of these raeces,¹ we may say, ae
we pass from west to east across the northern frontiera of the
plateae ol Itan, that the true Sclaronians estended from the
bordcrs of Assyria to those of Hyrcania and Parthia3 that they
there abutted on the dcbateable land or oscillating bonndary-line
between the Sclavenian and Gothic recca, and so became Massa-

regular Indo-Germanic ending, ir naturally derived from quiris, “a spear‚'’
what miserebis etymology it is to compare the former with caecidi,
“a champion,'' from car, “power,'' and the latter with coir, “just
honoornble, noble? Ano all regard for simple raasoning is neglected
hy a writer, who analyree wear = orirer into the Gauiish caea, “ a bird?
and tha Welsh car, ‘⁶ oare.”
