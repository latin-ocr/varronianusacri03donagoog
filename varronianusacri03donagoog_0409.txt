queit, qarbpr'ara, pari-que, qai-crit, and queis-qaam, may be seen
in the following passages ; Afranius ap. Cic. Taso. Dc’sp. 1v. 25,
§552 dummodo dolcat althaid, dotat qaidltbe‘t “provided he
only suffers corne pain, let him suffer orry pain you placso.”
Publius Syrus ap. Senec de Tranquill. XI. ξ 8: caieta potest
amare qaod cuiquam potest, “what may happen to aoy ono
ct att may happen to any crte μου plecte.'’ Caes. B. G. v. 34:
qcotcca quaqua coboea procurreret ab co porta mayaco boetiam
nemus cadebat, “aa often as every cohort advanced, a great
number ol the enemy fell.” Id. ibid 1. 35: qaam qaaepchm
colom aa orbo mearat bocoesfiayc'cbaot, “when any cohort left
the circle, the enemy fled.'’ The difference between aliquis and
peripsam consiste in the definiteness convoyed to the former by
its prefix att, so that while attaris means “ some one in par·
ticular‚'’ quisptam means generally “any one.” Thus in Cicero
(da Orat. 11. c. 9, 538) we have z “si de rebus rusticis agri·
cola precipiam, autetiam, id quod multi, medicus de morbis,
aut de pingendo pictor alegate diserte dixerit adt scripserit, non
idcirco artis illius putanda sit eloquentia.’' The addition of the
id qnod malti shows that quoipiam is more general than cla·-
quta: “if aoy percon versed in agriculture shall have written
or spoken with eloquenoe on rural affairs, or even any phy,-
sician on dioceses, as many have done, or sano painter cn paint·
ing, dre.n That there is much the same distinction between
cliqarb and qat'cpt'amas between aliquia and qais, is proved by the
existence and usage oi the compound otthobpiom or cliqer'piorn
(see Cic. Tunc. Dt'ap.111.9; I. F. Gronovius, cht'c. xm. 6). In
thc case of aliquia itself a stronger signification of separation or
definiteness may be conreyed by writing at length aliea 'aab or
path olias (see the passages quoted by Drakenborch, act Iria. v.
13, 54, p. 59). With regard to the definite force of qaedam, it is
to bc' remarked that there is a close affinity between δή and the
affix -dom or dam. Thus qai-dom is exactly bc δή, and φαί-
dem isyr δή. Το the same class belongs dmum, which Ebcl
(Zeti-scta f. Veryl. Sprcchf. 1851, p. 308) would explain aa a
superlative from the preposition de, on the analogy of primm
from prce. The forms tan-dem and pat-dem show that this
esplanation is antenable3 and the latter at all events proves
that dem and pri are not. contradictory designatione of time.
