being enbjoined‚ ae in tho Latin ΙιίοεῘιί-οε. This io a most
memoriae form, ae bearing immediately on adifficulty which
hna long been t'elt in Latin etymology. The quantity of the
laet syllables of aomo, intereo, poetro, propterea, seems at firet
right irreoonoilable with the supposition that theee worda are 'the
propositione antelatae, dra, followedby the nent aeona. aa.
And a eompariaon with poet-lm αᾱυενετιε hae (Fert. p. 246,
l. 8, dte.) might lead to the supposition that they aro ablativae
feminine, the regimen of the propositione being changed, aa ie
oertainly the care in Umbrian. Thia ie, at any rate, tho ,opinion
ol' Klenne (Phil. Adhondl. p. 45) and Mtlller (ad Feat. p. Ι247).
An English writer suppones that they may be deduoed from the
aeone. m, on the analogy ospo'at-quam, oete-qaam, dm. (Journal
of Edaoottbm 1. 106). But thie opinion involves a singular
mieooneeption. It ie much more reasonable to oonolude that the
demonstrative pronoun‚ in Latin aa in Oeoan, being generally

followed by the tennination -oe‚ made ite nent. pl. in -o-ae or '

-oeoe w'e have an inetanoe of thie in the demonstrative lai-o, the
nent. pl. ol which ie hoe, not lta-oe or ha. Now aa thie form
baa beoome Iro-o in paam, and ae quo-oo has heromo pro,
we may understand that, aa qao-proptter becomes quopropter,-
so omen-ce, or antem might'beoome aot’eo,· and ao of the
othere. At least, there is no other way ol explaining the neuter

forme quo and boo. Post-etat ie therefore a synonym for

poet-hoo =poethoo See below, Oh. x. ᾗ 4.

Pokopt't (in the Otppua Atell. l. 52, parlekapdi) may bo
rendered quondamque, and compared with the obsoleto ooooopt't,
itthia ia equivalent to qrtoeteoqroe in Faetus (p.· 364, Moneo:

however a different interpretation may be given: see below, Oh. vt.
512, Fr. 7. The ablativos kmwtid bastard must mean proedab
lebete. Inl. 13 we have kaatrm aleo contrasted with morae, which
must-zpoama, and eo we have an opposition of had to money
in each oaae. Of the differente of t'orm between kmtra‘d and
mmm thereie no explanation on the hypothesis that they are
canoa of the same noun. The former may be the ablativo of a
word analogonsto comper-ter, amaa-tar. The latter‘ must be
the recusative plural oia derivativo from thia under the tom
-vr or Fer (Now Crat. ξ 257). The forma μήτρως, perpetio,
