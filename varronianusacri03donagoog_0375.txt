of these nouns appear by the side of Greek nouus in -ος, and in old
Latin theo is still apparent, as in quom for qaam olom for oliab
or allis, dcc. A comparison ol aper with ὥγρός, Alexander· with '
Ἀλέξανδρος, and the like (sce Comen, 11. p. 53), shows that the
Latin forms have suffered an apocope not altogether unlike that
of scriba from reema, dcc„ and certainly due to the same ten-
dency to abbreviato and throw back the arcent. We have nonus
in aas which are never shortened into cr, as lunum, aemam,
corpores, aterus; and some compounds with the verb-rocta fer-
and per- present both the lull form and the apocope3 thus we
have araaiper by the side of mora'peraa. In these instances, of
course, the er is retained throughout the dcclension. But in the
oblique cases of aper and Alexander, as in the corresponding
Greek words, the e is dropt, aa might have been expected from its
obvious functione as a· merely compensatory insertion. The same
ie the case with a great many words of this form, especially
those which exhibit the termination signifying agency‚ which
corresponds to the Greek -ras, -τηρ, -τωρ, fem. -rpaa, -τριδ-,
such as mapa-ter, minas-ter, arbi-ter, doc. There is also in
Latin a longer form in -ιοτ,Ι coru. Those which retain the e
have generally some Greek affinity, which explains the importancc
of the letter. Thus puer must be compared with the Greek
nolp: liber, laterianetoepor or Διόνυσος ἐλευθέριος, is thus
distinguished from liber, lion poter, penori belongs to γένος,
γενε[σ]ος, penta, panea-2⁸3, and socer to ἕκυρος. It is to bc
observcd that although aper always loses its e in the oblique
cases, this unessential letter ie constantly retained in the corn· ’
pound japoaam=diaycram (above, p. 321). The pronoune alle,

haec, dac. lor ollas, psus, dcc, are singular instanoes of a form of ’

the nominative corresponding to the mere crude-somn as it ap-
pears in the vocative of this deolension.

It is an interesting fact that the Romans substituted the
second for the third deciension in some of the inflexions of
Greek noune in -εύς, -eor or -ἣς, oric· Thus they wrote

Achillei and Ultori as the genitives ot' Achillea (Axahhelc) aud ·

U Idaea (Ὀδυσσεύς), and Pericli for the genitive of Pericles (Περι-
κλέης). The latter change ie partly supported by the Greek
abbreviation of derivativas from κλέος, such as Πάτροκλος, Ἐτέ-
οκλος. That Hercules passed into Herculea or Herclaa may bc
