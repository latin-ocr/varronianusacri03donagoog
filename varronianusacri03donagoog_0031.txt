These aboriginal tribes, having been in the first instance,
like the Arcadiam in the Peloponnese‚ driven by their invaders,
the Pelasgians, into the mountain fastnessee of the Apenninee‚
were at length reinsorced hy foreign elementa, and, descending
from the interior on both sides, conquered the people of the

plains and the coast. One tribe, the Ap-ula', subdued the

dulae, οι· with the digamma οίιοιω, meant an ox or steer (Niebuhr, 1.
18 sqq), and Vitellium appears on coine ae a synonym ior Italia. This
takes us at once ιο the Gothic οιιιηο, 0. N. oedr, 0. Β. wither, dogio-S.
uado, 0. Η. G. ridor, N. H. G. widder (properly the eaenuted animal),
English watham and ae these are referred to sheep rather thau oren, we
must conclude that the nemeis an epithet which ie applicabis ιο either
animal. with regard to the other root, qv in AEqaur carries us back to .
the principle of combined but dirergent articulations, to which Idrst called
ιιιοοιίοιι (N. Crat. t 110, 121), and on which tho late Mr. (iamett wrote
some raluable papere (Plebi. Soc. rr. pp. 233, 2⁶7, ai), and we may infer
that tha route ap or op· present a labial only instead of an original oom-
bination of labial and guttural, while we find the opposite divergence in

the guttural forme coc-co, ech-0, Sousarmia, Gr. ὄχος, ἔχω, Goth. cahra, .

0. N. oa, Angla-S. oco, Ο. Η. G. obeo, N. H. G. eche, Engl. aa. The
labial form is sometimes strengthened by an inserted mtuaodrc, or homu-
geneoue liquid3 thus by the side oi dr-dpa and opo we hare ὀ-μ-φῦνεο’
αὔξειν. Hesych cf. dir-ripa, cao-tumeas (ahere the root οὑξ, auo-,auy-eo
*contains the guttural form οι· thie elemcut) and ὀ-μ-πη· sideria ὅθεν καὶ ἤ
Δημήτηρ ὀ-μ-πνίο. With these inductione ae shall hare no difficulty in
reducing to one origin and claseifyiog the different Italian names into
which the root opa- enters. The qu- is found only in AEqa-resr thep
appears in Opicuadpulast the guttural ie assimilated in ancr=Ob=eoua
(cf. δι’-σκοι for dia-oxos, λε’-σχη1οτλὲγ-σκη &0- N. ctat. b 219); the lablel
isrocalized in Ara-rom the a of tho termination is changed into r,
according to the old Italian practice, in Aa-ruacres=da·etmicce‚· and
the root-consonant is represented only by an initial oin Volaene=dpte
ιὶοίοιιι, which hae rauished‚ as usual, in the Hellenic articulation‘tthlavroe
(Herod. ru. 165). it will bo seen inthe aequal that Ι seok a very differ-
ent origin for the name Umbria, which Niebuhr apparently refers to

· this root: and it seems very strange to me that he should hare under- ·

stood the statement oi Philistus quoted by Dionysius (1. 22)z ἐξανα-
στῆναι δὲ ἔκ τῆς ἑουτῶν τοὺς Λίγυος r‘md re Ὀμβρικῶν aral Πελοογῶν, which
refers ιο the disposseeeion οι· the Celtic inhabitante of Umbria and
Etruria, ae belonging ιο the same traditione which led Antiochus to write
that the Siciliane were driven over into Sicily hythe Opicans (H. R. 1.
p. 82): for Antiochus ie speaking exclusis-ely of what toolr place iu the
southern extremity oi Italy, and the Pelasgians aud Ombrioi mentioned
by Philistus were the Tyrrheniaus and Umbrians of the north.
