when we merely ask lbr information. The employment of the
negative in the final sentence really emanates from this use in
interrogatione, conpled with the prohibitive value of the shorter
particle. The subordinate sentence, whether affirmative or nege-
tive, is generally coupled with thet on which it depende hy some
relative or interrogative particle. In Greek this particle cannot
be dispensed with, except in those cases, when the thing fesved,
denied, or doubted, is expressed by a prohibitive sentence, and
here the usual form of the final or illative sentence is relin-
quished3 but the use of ὥστε μή (Gr. Gr. Art. 602) shows that
this is merely an idiomatic omission, and δέδοικα μὴ θάνω might
,have been written δέδοικα oie μὴ θάνω, or ὥστε μὴ θανεῖν, “I
seer with a view to the result that Ι may not die.” The examples
collected by Mr. Allen (Anazyse of Latin Verbs, pp. 337 sqq.)
sufficiently show thatin Latin the relative pertiele et may be
either inserted or omitted at pleasure, whether the subordinate
sentence is affirmative or negative.
