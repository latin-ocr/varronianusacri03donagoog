us to expect prason if there were an inchoative from “ ’
proc or pree-,- cf. the Sanscr. prtebm’hdmh (5) there is nothing
to account for the omission of the r, which holds its ground in
other forms of the root, anderen survives the initial p in rap-o ,·
(6) the a being retained in poa-twlo must have belonged to the
root of the verb, rather than to a formative affix. It seems
more reasonable therefore to connect the word with the Teutonic
forakon, jerachon, on the analogy of pec, firtaa,· priserit, fiala·
pater, fatiem and to suppose that the original form was perseo
from porro or porse, and that the meaning was “to get farther
forwerd, to advance or presa on in ,question or intreaty;” The
semi-consonantal focio retains the ι’ in ita inchoative deponent ’
profici-acor, “I cause myself to set forth‚'’ i. e. “I set out‚’'
and the perfect projectus mm falls back on the form of the
primitive participle. Some consonantal verbs strengthen the
present with i before they assume the inchoative affix3 thus,
from penso, we have pem-icco, from nano, trem-iem, from
vieo, ravin-iaco (perf.‚revt'xt'); from the root noc, na-n-artcor,
nactas erim, from pan-90, pact-seor, pactus sam. The peculiar
verb ob-lio-r'aeaoor (from licor, lineo, liberem) meaning “I make
a black mark for myself,” “I obliterate‚’' “I forget‚” has the
perfect obli-tas ram. The forms which I bave mentioned have
either simply verbal roots, or corresponding verbs without this
affix. But there are some which are apparently derived from
substantives„as arbor-asco, ire-scor, paor-aceo, bano-aco, &a
It must be clear, however, to any philologer, that we must in
these cases assume an intermediate verb in -ya (=ao cr eo).
And while we find this supported in particular cases by sub-
stantivas and adjectives like urbm-etum, ire-tas, dre, the fact,
that there must hare been many such vowel-verbs which are .
now extinct, is shown by the appearance of many adjectivae
in -otaa, dtus, atae, derived from noune, but with the meaning
of passive participles3 such as eastern “bearded,'’ cart-tua,
“long-eared‚” corut-tam “homed,'‘ and many adverbs in tim,
with an active participial meaning, as catervi-tim, “ troopingly,’'
ybs-tim, “ sterlingly,” dac (above, p. 343, and below, (lh. 1111.
§dh The passive form of these perticipial words implies that
the vowel-verb, to which they are referred, is transitive, and in
