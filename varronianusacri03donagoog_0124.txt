the ultimate arficulation ol the other sound ol the Greek ζ. We
may compare itwith the 8·th (9); and, likethat Senserit

sibilant and the Greek ζ, it often appears as a soltcned guttural.

Thus we lind praedem for praeelecta, Lat. praesecto ,· and the ¹

termination dola, -lcle, -kla (Lat. οοιιιιι), often appears as -a‘lc,

-tla -dlra As in our own and other languages the gutturals are
softened. before the vowels e aud ι’, so in Umbrian tho guttural ‘
lc generally becomes sl before the same vowels. The sibilants‘
occurs only in contact with vowels, liquide, aud 6,· and the 4

prefix cea-,1 which drops the ιι before consonante, retains it before
vowels an ti.

(d) The letter uis always to be regarded as a recondary or
derived character. Ιιι Umbrian it generally represents, at the
end of a word, tho original sibilant s. When the Eugubine
Tables are written in Etruscan characters, we have such forms
as, ocrea ιιοιιῑοιιοι, ιιιιοο flechiam hut in those which give us
Latin letters, we read veria apuria, torar ly‘ouiaar. This change
is particularly observable in the inflexior of the Latin genitive
plural; and the Latin language, in other forms, uses the letter a
in the same way as the Umbrian. Ιιι fact, the most striking
characteristic of the Umbrian language is its continual employ-
ment of the secondary letters a and 11,bothof which are ulti-
mately derived from sibilante, or stronger gutturals. The former
is used in Umbrian, not only in the verb—forms, as in Latin,
but also in the dcclensious, in the Latin forms of which it only
occurs in the geu. plural. The letter Η is often interposed
between vowels both in Umbrian and in Latin. Thus we have
in Umbrian the forms ιιοΙιίιο, pilatu, for ιιοιο, pa'oto, and
Naharcam derived from Nar;and'1n Latin, οῙιοιιιιο Ηιινιιιοιιᾱο
