et once the possibility of a commuuity of origin in fero end ,

fendo. And as we cannot explain thedor tl in either case ass
,mere adjunct to the root, we must not be led hythe actual
change cfr into a, in some of these forms, to the conclusion that
this change hes taken place iu hendo and findo. As iu the case
of χα-ν-δάψώ, it is more iu accordance with scientific ressouing
to suppose that the a is here au oawrdro or euphonic nasah
aud the insertion of this eouud would naturally introduce the
mediol d before r, as iu dv-d-pde, aen-cradi, dre. But, as wa
have seen, the Latin r has a natural teudency to commutatico
with d. Consequently, its absorption or assimilatiou iu -heado,

fea-deo, and ferr-io, establish their claim to be considered es
members of the seme fer-tile stock.

§lt Defective Verba.

The epithet “defective‘' is applied to verbs witha very
restricted signification. Properly speaking, all impersonul verbs
are defective in the lst aud 2nd persons, end ell neuter and de-
ponent verbs are defective in voice, except when the former are
defective iu person. But it is customary to restrict the term
defective to those verbs which are specially incompleta iu the
machinery of their conjugation. Some of these ere really only
irregular appendages of existing verbs. Thus coaptis the usual
perfect of impio, memini of remisissem· ausim and saarim
are obsolete tenses of audeo aud facio, and the former of these,
with pendeo, fido, and soleo, has uo perfect of the active form3
qcoeeo, quesumus arethe original articulations of qnaero, queri·
mua· forem and fore are used with sam and fiai. Some few
verbs are employed iu a sort of interjectioual sense in the impe·
rative only, es apage, esca &ca others, as cole, which are thus

used, appear also as regular verbe. Odi, “ I hate‚'' “I have i

conceived a dislike,’‘ is the intransitive perfectos alost deponent,
correspondiug to the Greek ὀδύσσομαι (cf. ὄλωλα from ὄλλυμαι,
&ap this deponent form existe in the compound participles

000οω audporoeue. We can have no difficulty iu understaudiug ³
