This ia particularly the case in eompounds, as in seuam
from bellaper, which is formed from huam and perere. And we
must not overlook the fact, that nonna in s=ya are formed in the
same manner from consonant-verbs, not only in compounda like
apri-cola, ἠονηὺωὶία, tac, from colere, credo, dvc, bnt also in
simple fenne, as αἶα, “ that which ‘raises,” from alere,- linqua,
“ that which liclrs,” from liupana· toqn, “that which eorem,”
from tepere, &cc so that we may always maome an intervening
o- noan.

Verba in s are generally secandary extensione of simple
rools. Some, like lacere, are derived from consonant-nonas.
Not a lew, lilre ardere, favere, jirlqere, ponere, coexist with
nouns in -or=yor. The same, however, may be remarlred of
verbs in s3 compare amare by the side of amonem-yar, or
amo-pona. For aia-dulqco we‘must go bach to an assumed
datque, cf. the Greek δολιχός, ἒν-δελεχής, tw. (above, p. 91).
And foetw must be derived from soe-daa (originally fotus, “ by-
gone=stale‚” cf. ef-foetaa), which signifies “nasty,” referring, in
the first instance, to the smell, and, by a natural transition, to
whatever is disagreeable: thus we speak of “a nasty accident,”
&a The difference in meaning between the contmeted verb in
-eo and the simple verb in -o is shown in an interesting manner
by the two classes of verbs which include the root eda For
while arido means “to settle down,” recido, “ to talne a seat in a
’ recumbent posture,” wando, “to take a seat together,” abella
“to take a seat against,” oe, the corresponding contracted verbs
presume acontinuance of the quiescencc thus assumed; for redeo
is “ to sit,” resideo, “to continue in sitting posture, to reside,”

consideo, “to remain sitting together,” madeo, “ to remain sitting ⁸

before or against,’' especially of a blockading army. The latter
class of verbs are of course derived from nonus of which obses:
edred-a is a type. It is true that obesa for instance, does not
represent the common or applied meaning of ohaam. But both
words fall bach on the same primary signification; for “a
hostsge’' is a person sent to take his place by the side of those
' who hav'e the power.of execting such a security, and the word
therefore corresponda to ἔφεδρος in the sense mppwa‘tioim (Mar-
tial, v. Ep. 25), just as obsidere urbem answere to the Greek
ἐφέζεσθαι or περικαθῆσθαι (Ncw Orat.§172). The difference
