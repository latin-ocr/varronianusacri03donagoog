that dereecor must be a derivative from debeam, and that, like
acerque, cioca, from mernere, vivere, it must have an active ‘
signification. We have the verb der-ceco = dab-aero in the form
deraiktwt, decaikurent (dab-eecaaeit, dab-eecoveadnt). Conse·
quently, cremor dereoeor must mean eremi debaccantes, or dioci-
centea (for ἅίοοὼο, 4. conj„ see Gronov. Lect. Pharin. p. 87).
sacam cent is either audacti nent or orbecci eunt, i. e. aab·

means a priest 3 and the following seems to be the true analysie
oi the vvord. ·If we compare alonae “the nourisher,” with
alemano, “the nonrished,” and other forms in manne (Nero
Orat. guo), we may conclude that aramue has an active signi-
fication in reference to its first syllable. Now we have the root
are· in the Etruscan idm-pm, and probably in the =dea = ονε-α.
And whatever is the meaning ol the root of these two words, it

expect iu aroenae. Accordingly, it is a reasonable conjecture
that arcemone-mee means a sacrificial pilosi, or altar·
rnen. If this supposition be correct, vve shall have no great
'difficulty in translating the passage before us. Pe'r occurs so

after the ahalogy of precor, εὔχομιι. an is probably ore.
Nep stands ior aec, as in Oscan, bnt does not imply any dis-
