the· Oscan monuments (e. g. 0901001001) ; and that r was the
immediate representative of this a or a is proved not merely by
the fact that the Romans actually wrote -1011 for mm when
it suited their convenienoe¹, thereby showing the reason for
the omission oi the r in the other declaramus, but also by the
fact that the r is found in the pronouns, the oldest aud most
immutable parts oi speech, and that iu the more ancient state
of the language even nouus oi the other declensions retained the
r: thus we hear oi such words as 10001010, Jooerum (Varro,
Io. L. v111. §74), lapsuram, nuceram, vegetum (Gn. Gellius
apud Oluniium, 1. 40). This evidence receives very striking
confirmation from the analogy oi the genitive singular. The most
common characteristic of the genitive singular is the termination
-ia There are reasons, however, which may induce us to doubt
if this is the full sud original form oi the genitive-ending. The
Senserit 01110ἄογο compared with λύκοιο, and the possessive δημό-
σιος by the side of δημό-ιο, might lead us to suspect that tha ter·
mination commenoed withana, which was subsequently absorbed;
and this suspicion is confirmed by the fact, that there are, in old
latin, genitives ending in sumo where the r=a isuot partos
the crude form. Thus we have mes ior 01110 in the fragment
of Plautus quoted by Festus, a v. spetile, p. 330: “Esto pet-
nam, sumen 11110πέ, spetile, callum, glandia” Compare Varro,
L. L. v. § 110, p. 44. And from the extant forms 01 the nomi·
native plural in -res we may fairly infer that the genitive in
-rtit = so was not unoommon. The Latin possessive a‹ljectivcs end
in -iua or -0110, e. g. pauor-ius from pretor, seques from
uirgo, (cirpio-); and as the analogy 01 dead-oros, efflei-syo,
leads us tc an assumption of an original -sias, we must inserts
also in the pronominal genitivos in jeta, -110, which, as we shall
see in a subsequeut chapter, are derived from the possessives 01
the pronouns. We cannot doubt thet adjectivae iu ·we=-0noe
are formed from the genitive in -ao = -σιο, and aa these adjectivea
are only weaker forms of the quasi-comparativae in -ωινε-σων-ς,
the original form of the genitive must have been -σιον in Greek,
which would amount to -atom in Latin 3 aud the plural, originally
