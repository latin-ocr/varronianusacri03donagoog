and a hall,’' we have the componnd mqairres, “a foot and a
hall,’' and its derivative adjective sesquipedalia Again, when
the first part of a real componnd is an indeclinable word, it
may be separated by a imam from the inflected part of the
compound; thus we have inque salutante ior insolentesque,
and per· rechimirum videtm for permiram. In such forms as
achiba-minua, dam-taxat, vida-ais, immolandas, scilicet, doe,
the two words are merely written in continuity to show their
hasty ntteranoe in the dow of conversation. Sometimes it re·
‚ quires a carefnl analysis to prove that the word is really a com-
pound. Thus anans or anus seems at first sight to be necessarily
a simple word3 but it is proved by philologieal dissection
(p. 193) to be a shortened form of decade=del νεόμενος (cf.
odpovde and daea-vde, according to the old notion of a welle
superincumbent firmament, and a amisi stream flowing round the
earth), and the idea attached to the word is that which is ex·

Then again it is an etymologieal discovery that pres, mastos,

opu-lentas, richewardo, are not merely derivative forms, but ·

real compounds (above, pp. 146, 464), and the same remark
applies to the verbale in -bilis and -bandus, which involve the
verb of becoming (pio), and are not to be explained, like the

derivatives in -balam, aa oeno-bulum, by a mere reference to .

the pronominal formatioris. The words in -cins'am seem at first
sight to express very leebly the meaning of the verb can-o, if
we except the two words palii-oinium, “ the crowing of a cock,’'
and nati-ciniani, “the singing of the bard” (Nepos, xxv. 16 fin:
“ Cicero cecinit ut vates’'). It is quite possible however that
ceno may have denoted repetition, repeated action, the playing a
particular part (compare the usage of ὑμνῶ, παίζω, diripe), and
so camoenas-s· and ratiocinari will mean to go over a topic of

discourse, or to investigate a process of arithmetic or reason, ·

with an idea os repetition or habit implied3 and similarly, ἰαινο-
cinium, lenocinium, patrocinium, tiro-oinium will denote the
habitnal action or employ of a robber, a procurer, a patron, and
’ araw recruit. It is remarkable that all the words of this class
