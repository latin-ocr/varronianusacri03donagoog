as in Greek must be “to cut off.” And as πέρ-νημι means “to
export,” or “ sell,” we see that aper-ao or ca-per-aor only
carries the idea oi separation into that of rejectiou. With re·
gard to cer-no and κρί-νω it is worthy of remark, that while
they agree in expressing their prima-ry idea, “ separation,” or
the sifting out of that which is mixed up in confusion, they
fall back, by the msoeiation of contrast, to au agreement with
nepai-unvai, “to mix,'' (see Nero Crat. ξ 53). From the primary
meaning “to see or distinguish,” that of “ selection, choice, or
jndgment,'' naturally llows; and we find that cer-ao by itself,
and in its compound dacer-m, accords in this respect with the
common uae of κρίνω. This is particularly observable in the
idiom cerame hereditatem, “to declara oneself (as distinguished
’ from all others) lawful heir to au estate,” as Varro says (L. L.
vll. ξ 98, p. 158, Mallon: “apud Plautum (Oa‘etell 1. l, 1.):
Quia ego antehac te amari ct mihi amicam esse crud,
crevi valet constitui ,· itaque heres, quom constitnit se heredem
esse, dicitnr cernere, et quom id fecit orccahac.’' How far cer-ao
is connected (as Varro thinks, L. L. vl. § 81) with creo, Sanscr.
aaa, is perhaps not easily determined. The most interesting of
the verbs, iu which a appears as an adjunct, are li-no and si-ao,
for these two, as has been said more than once, play an impor-
tant part aa agglutinata auxiliarics. The common meaning of
li-ao is “to besmear,” i. e. “to overlay with something adhesive.”
This cannot, however, be the primary meaning of so simple a
root. It is much more reasonable to conclude that the first sig-
nification is simply to lay down, and thus it will iumish ns with
the clement of the Ο. Ν. Icto and its Etruscan correlative (above,
p. 212). We shall also find in this an explanation of a number
of Scaudinavian and Sclavenian sonus, into which l- enters as a
verbal adjacet, and, what isos more importance to our immediate
object, we shall ece in this the origin of the Latin verbs in -lo, as
’ cavillor = woer[e]·lor, “I let myself take eare,'' i. e. “I raise
cautious objections or special pleas. for myself‚” corracribillo=
macheda-l, “l let write,'’ “I indulge in it at random,”
omnimedens-b, “I let sip,” “I indulge in sipping,” dac.
As all these verbs belong to the a· conjugation, we must recog-
nize in them an extension by means of τὶ, and this is necessary
to explain limo, A. III. le·oi; ar2no, A. III. οῖ’-νὺ sero, A. III.
