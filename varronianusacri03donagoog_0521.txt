§lh (II.) Derdved Verba.

Alter what has been said on the subjectos the conjugatione,
the derivative forms of verbs will not involve a lengthened
discussion. We have seen that, in addition to the second pro-
nominal clement under the form i = ya, which appears in· the
eontracted verbs andin so many other derivativas, we have two
varicties of consonantal addition, -a and -sc, which increase the
verb-lists by many important predicatione. These have been
discussed in their proper places, as exemplos of the different‹
conjugatione. But although all these verbs are derivativas,
there are some of them which may be considered as specially or
doubly deserving of this title3 namely, as derivativas from deri·

· vates. ‘Thus we have a large class of frequentatives in i-t[a]o,

shortcned sometimes into -t[a]o, which must, upon . a strict
analysis, be regarded as derived from nouns which may have

, been themselves derived from verbs. We see this at once in

milit-[a]o‚ “to play the soldier,'' from mila, crude form milia.
For miles is derived, like pedae, dre, from a word compounded
· with a'-t-‚ from dre (above, p. 315); so that melito really in-
volves a derivative from eo. In the same way, interpret[a]or
comes from interprc[t]s‚ a word, which, like pretium, involves
the preposition per and the verb τὶ, “to go;” so that pretinm
means “that which changes hands” (cf. πέρ-νημι, erp-dere, πρ-
· ίαμω, dre), and interpr-iac is “one who goes between two

· parties in making a bargain, or serves as the medium of com-
munication in any way” (cf. paries, lllcw Orat. ξ lv 8.) Although
we have not the intervening noun in all or most of the other
frequentatives, we may infer that it once existed, from these and
other instancea because, as we have seen, any verb may have a
noun of agency in -t-a or t÷r formed from it. Accordingly, if
milito comes from mike, and interpretor from interpres ‹ry-ito

¹ and its compound cop-ito ·- co-cqs'to, must presumo a noun oqea=
oq-its. As we have seen, the affin ·t·s, denoting agency, may be ’

represented by-dus ,- thus we have rapa-dmrnp-i-eacmap-tor ,0
capa-das =eap·s'-eaa, dre. Now we have paci-das =paaeaa by
the side ospes-ito,- and from this and other exemplos we may
conclude that the iteratives in -ω are derived from nonus of ⁰
agenoy in -t-s or aas, whether this noun cf ngencyis interme-
