arcamarcaa-c, in the former language, would becom acas-2
detra iu Latin, from which it is sostened to -artm, just aa the -uc
of πόλεως falls into -ra iu cajeta, dre. Compare also the Sauscrit
daal chyam with the plural capas cr clia

§a aa aare aas aare.

In Greek, the dative, as the case denotiug rest aud proximity,
indicates whatever is close at haud, and thus ilnplies the in-
strument or occasion, as well as that which is receptiva of gain,
or that which is the locality of the action. In other words, it ·
includes the three Sanscrit cases, which are denoted as the in·
strumental, the dative, and the locative. These three cases end
in -ἰηα, -ayo, and -s‘. There is reason to believe that the first of
these affixes is the original type. It is identical with the forms
ci-vd, iva, originally faro, and it thus appears that it is only
partially represented by »pa -ba', -a', which are the usual termi-
natione of the Greek and Latin dative and locative. The Greek
prcuouns, ἐμίν, reth, τίν, ἵν, cdlv, φίν, piu, contain the whole

affix, and it always appears iu the Greek dual, as in αὖ-τό-ινε .

αὐτό-φιν, where the characteristic of plurality is omitted, as in
the Latin plural -aam -- eum. We may also conclude that the
Latin -te, iu audes, υο-ῠὺ, has lost the a necessary to the full
form, which is preserved in the particle aina, which is presumed
in words like effictae, and which appears slightly altered from
the Senserit instrumental in words like partim, caim, olim, ratim.
The termination -da'=·pa is dative aud instrumental in ιε’-ὀί,
ero-bia but simply local in a-bi, iti, &c Commouly the Latin
locative ende in -ί, agrceing in this with the Sauscrit. But when
the characteristic ol the noun is a consonant, it is generally
shortened into a, especially if the word is of more than two syl·
lables. The locative of rara is rari. In the plural the dative
and locative are always confused with the ahlatire3 aud instances
occur even iu classical Latin where the dative of an ordinary
noun, with the sense of imitation, appears in the form of the
ablativa in e. Iu some phrases this is rather the rule than the
