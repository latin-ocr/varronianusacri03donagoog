nox for nocta (above, p. 254); and virgil (Aba. 1. 2153 vn. 624)

tion to this usage in the indeclinable Greek debus (Buttmann,

Aosf. &procat 1. p. 227).
§ 12. Adnerhial expressionfhr tlte day of the montlr.

To these instances of the adverbia] use of nouus may,
perhapS, bc added the phrase by which the Romans designated
the day of the month. Here a locative of the day is inserted
between the prepositiou and the word whichdenotes the standard
of rechoning. Thus, “on the fourth day before the Neues of
April,‘’ is expressed by ante (die quarto) Nonae Aprilcr=qaorto
die ante Nonas Apriles. And this whole expression is regarded
as one word, which may be dependent on a preposition: thus we
may say, cx ante d. iii. Non. ,ἧι-η. usqae ad proiice Kal. Βῳίωη-
bres, or defferre aliquid in ante d. XV. Kal. Novembres. This idiom

was carried so far that even when the Ides themselves were i

· intended we have the phrase aaa Idae instead of [dabas. Thus
Liv. 111. 40: onte Ideo Motha decemviros obtare moqahtratrr.

If the inserted date was ever written or pronouuoed iu the
accusative case, according to the ordinary practice among
modern Latinists, it is obvious that this must have originated
in an attraction, or in a mistaken usage. 'Phe well-known
employmeut of the locative prtia to indicate the day imme-
diately before the Calends, Nonas, or Ides, shows that the other .
days must have been expressed in the same case.
