in understanding the relation between the Etruscans und the
other Italian tribes. Long after the Tyrrheno-Pelasgians had
’ established their civilisaticn on both sides cf the Tiber, and had
conquered the Umbrian mountaineers in the north, but yielded to

the Oscan cr Sabine highlanders in the south, long aster this time ,

¹c Ratian tribe eallied forth from the plains of Lombardy, where
it was settled in nnbrolren connexion with sister tribes in the

. .Tyrcl end south-western Germany‚ and not only effectcd a per-

manent conquest ol Umbria, but also settled itself ae a military
aristocracy among the civilised Tyrrhenians on the right ol
the Tiber. These conquerors included in their progress the

Tyrrheno-Iatin city, Rome, which had just shalren off the in· ,
. fluence of the Tarquinii, hut they lost this and their other aequi·

-sitions beyond the Tiber, in consequence of e defeat which the
,dominant Olusians sustained at Aricia. In every feature cf this

‚Etruscan invasion we may observa an analogy tc the similar pro-
ceedings cf the Gallie tribes, who at a still later period descended

into Lombardy from the west. They succeeded in breaking
through the continuity cf the Raetian settlement by establishing
themselves in the territory afterwards called Cisalpine Gaul.
They also invaded Umbria and Etruria, besieged the imperial
city cf Clusium, and even sacked Rome. But they were borne
back again, not without a severe struggle, to the region from
which the Etruscans started, and the city of the Seven Hills
was to each of these northern invaders the limit of their progress
to the south.
