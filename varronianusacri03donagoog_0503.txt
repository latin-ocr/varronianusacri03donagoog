The word ecclam “heaven” must be regarded as a seoondary
and derivative word. That the word should be spelled with aa
and not with oc is proved by the gloss in Hesychius ; καίλους·
οὐρανούς. Ῥωμαῖοι, and this orthography is supported bytho
best authorities (Wagner, Orthoyr. Verpc'd p. 419). 'she other
spelling ecclam was suggested by the belief that the word was
merely the Greek rothom And though an immediate derivation
from the Greek is fallacious in the case of such an ancient Latin
word, it seems more than probable that the idea of the vvord
lssds us back to every similar notion‚ that oi emptiness and
hollowncss. Foris we compare cc-ccaa with χαοί (above p. 7),
cohors vvith χορός, cccco with garire and xer-reddre), caras with
χαίρω and χάρις (see Nem Orat. ἓξ 287, 323), we may easily
understand the connexion cimam vvitlr the root χψ, and we
shall recognize another form in the obsoleta codam (Fest. p. 39: ·
codam poetae caelum dixerunt a chao, ex quo putant caelum csse ,
formatum), which is also connected with the root of nouae
(Hesycb. κόοι· τὰ χάσμςτα τῆς ’γῆς acl τὰ κοιλώματα). That the
verb caelo is derived from the noun ecclam, and notarice cerco,
as tho older authors supposed (verrom. v. 3 [8]. Cicero,
Verres, 11. 52, ᾖ 129. Plin. H. N. 11. 4), must bc regarded by
every philologer as a seli-evident proposition. The root oi

' caelum is contained in another word of some interest and diffi-
culty. The connexion of mlum and caelebs was recognized by
the old grammarians‚ though their explanation of the etymology ,
uss very absurd. Festus says (p. 44): “coelrbem dictum -ex- aql,
istimant quod dignam caelo vitam agat.'' If vve fall back on ,
the primary meaning of cctam, which has just been indicated,
we shall see that caelebs finds a natural explanation as asynonym
oscidates: compare t e Greek χῆμος, which contains the same
or {mgnum root. The hof the crude—form coelib- is merely a
pronominal affin, like that which is found in the endings -brrms
and -baltan, and wc have a further extension in the adjective
alicae used cs an epithet of hacta, the spear with a bent
point, with which the hair of the bride vves combed or partcd, for
one of the various reasons mentioned by Festus (a. u. actitari
