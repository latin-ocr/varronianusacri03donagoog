accusative ·m.· thus, from the demonstrative ahand the relative
qai, we have i-bi aud a-bi, originally cabi, comp. oli-caedi, &aa
from ahta we have satim, &c.; and the ending -m appears in
aas-quom or sapsam, dre.;-(b) “motion towards,’' iuwhich case
they end iu -o.· as atrro, “to a place beyond” (see Ddderlein,
Syn. n. Etym. 111. pp. 105 sqq.); qao, “ whither;” eo, “thither’'
&c.; sometimes -o is appended: thus we have illuc, satos, by
the side of allo, altor—(c) “motion hom‚'’ in which case the
ending is nde, or -nce‚ -nqaer thus we have i-rade from is,
[cp-ade from qai, alia-nde from alins, aiae from lai-c, illi-ne
homello, turrimque from adera-(d) “the way‚’' in which cose
we have a feminine ablativo in -d agreeing with aid understood,
ss qud, ea, dre. The forms of class (c) deservo some special
remark. The comparison of tam with tunc shows that the a
would have been written m, if the e had not'been appended.
And the same remark applies to made, lia-o, illia-c, sitia-c:
ior caim occurs in Lucretius [see Lachmann on111. 161), and
Bitschl has 'claimed illim and haia for the text of Plautus
(Rasin. Mos. 1850, pp. 472 sqq.). But thia does not interfere
with the inference that the accusative and locative mis the re·
presentative ol sn original dental. There cau be no doubt that
the termination -de is identical with that of the ablative‚ and, as
we have seen, with the termination aas. Bopp‚ who was aware ⁵
of this (Vcrpl. Graiam. p. 610), proposes to consider the same
letter as included iu haiae, illinc, aaziae, which he regards as cor·
ruptione nitiade, illium, atinde. I should not desire any other
proof oi the importance of the distinction which 1 first introduced
into the analysis nithe pronomina} elements (Now Orat. ξ 130).
According to the principle which regulates all combinations of
these elements‚ n÷c denotes motion “from the there to the
here,’' and therefore expresses ablation or removal quite as natu·
rally as the affix -de=-tas‚ which is in fact ultimately referable
to the same source (Ν. Orat. § 262).

Pronominal adverbs of time generally end in -sa, as tum,
quaram in -no, nque, ns tae-nc, conqua- or in -ndo, -saqaom, ss
qua-ndo, rsonqaom. ⁴

Adverbs derived from nouus adjective aud substantive either
end in e, ο, or ter; or else they are merely adjectives in the
neuter objectire case.
