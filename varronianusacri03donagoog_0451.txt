future. It is, in fact, an extension of the noun of agency in
-tor ,· compare proetor, peretum acn'ptor, achatae-c, dre. with the
corresponding future in -tarue of proeco, acribo, dre. (see Ncw'
· Orat. 5 267). The Greek future participle ¹is sometimes used
as a mere expression of agency3 thus we have in Soph. Antip.
261: οὐδ’ ὁ κωλύσων παρῆν, Aristot. Ett. Nic. '11. l, ᾗ 7:
οὐδὲν ἂν ἔδει τοῦ thermae-where we should use the mere
noune of agency-“ the make-peace '’-'‘ the teacher.”

Now it is impossible to take an instructis-e view ol these
forme without considering thern together. The participle in
etam (y) is a derivative from the verbal in -tus (ὣς and it
would ho difficult to avoid identifying the participle in -adua and
the corresponding gernndial infinitivo. ln the following remarks, .
therefore, I shall preeunte, what hasbeen proved elsewhere (Nem
Crat. ξ 416), the original identity of the infinitive and the par-
ticiple.

That the verbal (a), which acte as the ordinary infinitive in
re =re, ie derived from the crude form of the rerb hythe eddi-
tion of a pronomina} ending εῖ- urcy, is clear, no less from the
analogy ol the AEolic Greek some in ηις, where the ι is trans-
posed (comp. N. Crat. 5410, (3)), than frorn the original form
of the passive, which is -ra'er= syer, and not merely -rer, This
infinitive, therefore, is the indeclinahle state of 'c derivative
precisely similar to the Greek noune in -σις (πρᾶξις, pri-ece,
«leel, which express the action of the verb. This Greek ending
in -ore appears to hare been the same in effect as mrother ending
in -τύς, which, however, is of less frequent occurrence (ἔπη-τός,
fieris, timo-erle, dte), but which rney be compared with the
Latin infinitivo (h) in -mm, -hc, (the supine, es it is called), and
with the Senserit gerund in -tut 'l'he verbal in -ttaes, which is
assumed as the origin of these supinos, must be carefully distin·
guished from the passive participle (β) in em. For it appears,
from forms like mum, dre, and the Oscan infinitivea molturam,
mm, alcum dre, that the t of the supine is not organic, but
that the infinitive (b) is formed like the infinitive (a) hy o suffix
belonging to the eecoad pronominal clement, so that the labiel
(Π = v) is an essential part of the ending. On the other hand,
the participle (β) has merely a dental suffix derived from the
third pronominal clement, and corresponding to the Greek
