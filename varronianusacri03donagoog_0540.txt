final s, though written, was not pronounoed (Nero Orat. ᾗ 242),
we have a number ol words in which the termination -dr or -us
was regularly abridged to -e⁹.· suoh as ille, eirea, muge, dre, for
ellus, spots, mopsi, &e The contemptuous familiarity with
which the master addressed his slaves gave rise to a number of
abbreviatione of the Greek names of the letter. Thus Artori·
derue w'as called Artemus (Varro, L. L. v111. 521), Epaphro-
ditas became the Epaphras of St Paul, and Demodorus shrunk
into Demus or Dama (Hor. 2. Ser-m. v, 1013 uid. vl, 54).

But the hasty pronunciation of the Romans, so far as it was
exhibited in the written forms of the language, appears chiefly
in the omission of letters or syllables in the middle of words.
If the hurried talker has time to pronounoe more than one sylla-
ble, he would rather preserve the termination than any of the
middle sounds. Indeed, the acoent sometimes stands over the
ruins of a number of syllables, whieh it has fused into one oom-
pound articulation. The following instanoes, selected from a
very large number, may serve to illustrate this: Ale for Axilla

(Cic. Orat. 0. 45, § 153), ape for oblite (Fest. p. 22), aab (olla) l
for aneilla, bruma (soil. dees), “the shortest day,” from nmmos, '

ooreer from co-aroeo, contaminare, the derivative verb from eoa·
tapioles, oontr'o sor conventio, mavilium for mettium, cunoe for
urdine, decurio for decemuiris, dixti for dhare· (seo the nnme-
rous instanoes oolleoted by Corssen, 11. 26-33), arealis for wi·
paldo (from eyeo, of. arigerae), tmere for infimus, jusso for jussero,
jucundas for jeveirmmdus, hrptsseidr‘noe for opulentitatem for
maxilla, molleis for mobilis, ornantem sor opimentum, 010000 for
opitr‘am, Pollius for Publilius (Nieb. Η. R. 1. n. 977), pandas
for pauxillus, porcat forporro areat (Fest. s. v. arceo, p.15,
Moller), prudens sor prouidens, puella sor paenale, qualus for
quasillum, sacellum for sooraoelam (oomp. sukorulrlrtm Herdcleta
=eaoellum Herorele's, in the Cuppae Abellanae, l. 11), setara· for
