Gervetri, the following inscription is traced in very clear and
legihle charontem

Mi ni lesdam mimalia marum liiioi depereant:
Ede erui aie spana, mi neda nanae delapsa

Itie obvious that there is an heroic rhythm in these lines; the
punctuation and division into worda are of course conjectural.
This inscription differs from those which are found in the Um-
bro-Etruscan or Rasemc districts, and especially from the Peru-
sian cappas, in the much larger proportiones vowela, which are
here expressed even before and alter liquide, and in the absence
of the mutilated terminatione in c, l, r, which are eo common in
the other monuments. The meaning of this couplet seems to be
ae follows: “ I am not dust; Iam ruddy wine on burnt-ashesr
when ” (or “ if”) “there is burning-heat under ground I am
water for thirsty lips.” Mi is clearly the mutilated d-pi= ὄιν-μί’.
That the substantive verb may be reduced to ἐ-μί, with the first
syllable short, is clear from the inscription on the Burgon vase,
which Beckh has so strangely misunderetood (OJ. n. 33), and
which obviously consiste of three metica: τῶν 'Adiit-mydas ἄ- Ι
θλων ἐμί. ΙΙ Ni is the original negative, which in Latin always
appears in a reduplicated or compounded form. The same form
appears in Icelandic. chumais the primitive form of χθών,

shoot of the Hebrew ΠῼἘζ, in which the cuph, aa in many other
cases, represents a attonger guttural? (see above, p. 91). The

¹ Dr. Ia. Stenb (aar neeesse Ettnoloyis, p. 223) considers that mi

changes mini into mima and so slso in the Naples inscription, where he
reads: sum mamus Valtha ia Popiliana, and rendere thc words, ms
