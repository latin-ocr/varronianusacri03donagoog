and that Tomi-ramesiae, or “Neptune'' is, by interpretation,
“the god ot* the see.” It does not appear that the second part
of the name Temarunda is a distinet word in itsslf. It seems
more probable that it is a feminine termination‚ analogous to that
of serendo from soe=“sea‚’' in the A. S. document quoted by
Grimm (Gcseh. d. damah. Spe. 1. p. 234), who also compares
the name of the river Timavus as explained by Strabo, v.
p. 214. For Pliny says (vl. l); “Scythae...vocant...Mteo-
tim Temarundam, quo significent matrem mara? And as
Μοιῆτιο, which seems to be another form os the Zend neate
anate, is stated by Herodotus (lv. 86) to mean μήτηρ τοῦ
Πόντου, it is more than probable that Temarunda is a quslifying
epithet of Meretri, and that it denotas maritima. The word
Tama perhaps signifies “broad water ;'' lor the river which
is called the Ia-ca while it is narrow, becomes the Tamis-eir, or
“Thomas‘’ when it begins to widen. That the name of a man
like Octa-maeodaa should be significant of veneration will not
surprise those who recolleet the Scythian name Sparge-prisea (the
son of Tomyris, Herod. 1. 211) or Speras-pithoa (a king of the
Agathyrsi, id. 1v. 78), which seems to be equivalent to the
Senserit Scorpo-pati, “lord oi heaven’'-apcr9e bearing tha
same relation to soarqa that the Persian appa does to the Senserit
epea ,· and the Zend ppos, old Persian epalea, Sclavenian subulca,
te the Senserit eod (ecam), Greek etiarm

Leaving the names of divinitics, we may turn to the scarcely
less mythologicsl Arimaspi. Herodotus says that they were a
one-eyed people (μουνόφθαλμοι), and that their name indicatos
as much-dpepa γὰρ ἓν καλέουσι Σκύθαι, σποῦ δὲ τὸν ὀφ-
θαλμόν. Eustathius (ad Dionys. 31) gives a different division
of the componnd, which Hartung would transfer to the text of
Herodotus: ἅρι μὲν ’γὰρ τὸ ἓν Σκυθιστί, μασπὸς δὲ ὁ ὀφ-
θαλμός. It appears to me that Herodotus is in error respecting
the meaning ol the word, end that the true explanation is to be
songht in the epithct ἱπποβάμον, which AEsehylus (Prae. 830)
applica to this people:
