§ 8. Tac. Ι. b, 13 sqq.

The next passage which deserves notice and admits ofa
reasonable interpretation is the following. Many of the inter·
vening sentences, however, ere so like that which has just been
examined, that they can cause no real difficulty to the student.
In I. b, 13, we have ·

cnumelc stephan pary‘am torvam tcse, Tute Itucinc.

The first wordis aperticle of connexion signifying iude, deis,
“then” “in the next place.” It is eleo written iaamck, end
seems to bc compormded of icum (the Lat. cuim) and de,- com·
pare the Gothic omero, dte.

Steplatu, stiplatu, and ora-stephan, crs the imperatives of
a verb atiplo or accepto, which seems to bc of proper applica-
tion in matters of augury. In old Latin strpulus vves synony-
mous with subulis (Forcell s. v. spalatin: consequently this
verb must signify something like stabilio or firmo, which last
word is used in speaking of omens (V irgil, (ἴσως. lv. 386).

Porfo, which occurs frequently in the Tables, is the anguriul

porro, akind of owl, which the Italicus in general call ciccum ’

und the Venetians pomaeo ,· and tesca ‘means on the right: as
will appear from the following considerations. At the beginning
of the sixth Table we have, among the auspices, paryb ermae

· demas ptt'qv μέσα morata ,· which should seem to mean, par-

ram, corac'cem, deceta„ picum, picam sinant-os. The &man
auguro used to turn their faces to the south3 consequently the
east was on their left, and the west on their right. The east was

in general the seat of good omens3 but iu certain cases, und with p

certain birds, the bed omen of the west, or right hand, might hc
converted into good. They mede a distinction between the birds

which gave the omen by their note, and those which gave the

omen by their flight3 the former were called moisen the letter ³

alites. The parra and the pr'caac were rechoned in both classes,
according to Festus (p. 197, Mttller). Indeed there must have

been some confusion among the augure themselves, as Cicero 1

seems to admit (ds Dicin. 11. 39): “ Haud ignoroque bons
sint, sinistra nos dicere, etiamsi dextra sint3 sed certe nostri

sinistrum nominaverunt, externique dextrum, quia plerumque me- l
