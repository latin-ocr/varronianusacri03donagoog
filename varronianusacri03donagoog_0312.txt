The labial s and the guttural Q, are the most characteristic
letters in the Latin alphabet. Os the latter I will speak inita
place, merely remarking here that its resemblance to reonsisu
in the fact that they are both compound letters, although used
from the earliest period as exponente of simple sonnds.

In considering the Latin r, we must be careth] not to confuse
it with the Greek φ on the one hand, or with the modern von
the other. Itis true that s corresponds to φ in a number of

words, such as fayaa, forna, fero, fallo, fari, facab, frater, frr‘·
yae, fiac-aa, firpio, fai, fabae, far (Mullar, aaut. 1. p. 20);

but we must consider these words as an approach to a foreign
articulation3 for in a great number ol words, in which the F has

subsequently been commuted for Η, we can find no trace of con·

It is generally laid down that Ρ and v are both labio-dental
aspiratos, and that they differ only as the tenuis differs from the
medial; and one philologer has distinctly asserted their identity,
meaning perhaps that in Latin r=the English v, and u= the
English w. If, however, we analyse some of the phenomena ol
comparative philology in which the Latin r appears, and then
refer to Quintilian’s description of tho sound of this letter, we
may be disposed to believe that in many cases the English v
formed only'a part of the sound. Quintilian says (ΧΗ. 10,
§Q 29) that the Roman language suffered in comparison with
the Greek from having only v and n, instead of the Greek υ and
φ, “qasbua aalla apud eoa (Graan) dalaias spirant. Nam
