or τὸ ὕπαρχον, exhibit the formation under discussion, without
eny additional elemento. But poardus gen. moder-is, leude us
to the same class of words as opas, opero, end these, as we hare
seen (abore, p. 355), are terminated by the sostened dental, es
an additional mark of objectivity. The ablative pondo, however,
shows thet there must have been a word pondos, pondi, corre·
sponding to flendos, fiendi, end the synonymons ablativo sponte,

porra, pontis (in old Latin abbreviated into poe, Varro, L. L. v.
1. p. 3, Milller) originally referred to a weight laid down, or
ponred forth, such, for example, es an embanhment, a mass ol
eanhwork, or separate stenes thrown intothe water (γέ-φυρα),
which was the primary notion os abridge, as the means ol
crossiug a stream: for we need not go far to prore the untiquity

Α the t of sponte is retained in potati-see, es describing the'fnne-
tions of the priest‚ who settled the atonement for a specific fault
by the imposition of e fine, on pryment ol which he pronounced
the offender free from guilt, so that he stands opposed to the ἢ
corni-fex, who exacted satisfaction on the body oi the delinquent,
without incurring the guilt or the danger of Shyloek. We bure
asimilar idea in the Hebrew pp? (see Probet. Pla. io Debere

Canticum, cantabr. 1848, p. 10). The connexion of the root·
so=eoo=bvo=xef or χῐε with po or spo, is further shown by
the community of meaning between χῶμα and pone, between
σπένδω andfimdo. And we may also compare fhus with pontus,
which properly indicates the depth of the sea (whence ποπίζω,
“to sink deep in the weter”)‚ end so corresponds to fiendas,
