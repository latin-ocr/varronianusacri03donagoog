In the languagcs derived hcm the Latin the eompound pomerio
is represented by como Sp, conte It, and comm Fr.; in which
the d is omitted, and in the last, as iu the old French uam (be-
low, 59), the syllable is dropt altogether. The knowledge cl

this abbreviated pronunciation enables ns sometimes to cornea e

neoda was monosyllabic‚ and though one of his best MSS. in
Plautus, Tria. 11. 4, 17 9=580‚ gives the reading εἰ for et, he has

It will not be expected that I should here show at length
how the Romanos langnages were formed from the Latin. It
will be sufficient to point out some of the reasons for believing
that the French language is a better living representative of the
pronunciation of the ancient Italians than the language which is
now spoken in the peninsula itself3 and, in conclusion, to state
bricfly what was the process of the disintegration‚ and in what
degree the modern differcd from the ancient form.

must have learned in his younger days that an ablativa of manner repu-
