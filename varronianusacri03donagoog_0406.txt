substantival, and welcher, which is declined like a regular suh-
stuntive. As Kritz says, quis and qaid merely ask for the
name, hut qui and qood inquire respecting the kind, condition, or
quality of the person or thing. Thus, in the passages adduoed
by Grysar (dhoet-ie deo lat. Scyle, p. 88) and in those quoted
above, quis stands by itself, or in apposition to a noun, but qui,
like an adjective, isa definite epithet, eg. T. Quia fuit egitur?

the first question refers to the unknown name, and the second
eeeks a distinction between him and others who hore the same
designation. Similarly, in the passages quoted above, when
there is an opposition, quid tihi raomen est means “whot is your
namc?” but quod aomos would mean “whr'ch name?” qur's
ι casus means “wltat chance?'' or “what for a chance?” as the
Scotoh say: hut qai cosas would mean “wdr‘cd chance?” or
“what kind of a chance?'’ Just the same is the distinction of
wer or war and wolcler given in the German dictionaries. For
ifthe question is: wer hat dir es popedon? “who has given it
to you?” and the‘answer is, meio Bardo, “my brother,” we
should add the further question, wdetor’ “which brother?” if
there were more than one.

The adjectisal character of pai as distinguished from pares is
common to the genitive of oll the demonstrative and relative pro·
nouus which end in jus, as hujus, serito, ill-ius, ejas, spa-ius,
cajus, quo-jus. We have seen that the personal pronouns use,
instead of their proper genitive, the genitive of their possessis-es,
meus, tous, saus, and analogy would leod us to infer that sorne-
thing similar is found in the other pronouns. Now cujus -a, -um
is a regular adjective, and its derivative apos, najoth must be

compared with the Greek forms like πολιήτης, Ἰταλιώτης, (N. ,
Orat. 5259). It is clear that these last forms must b's derived i

suggested long ago that the Latinjar represents under a weaker

form this genitive ending -yds or -eu'oeyoe for -ιοθεν (Ν. Orat.
5248). The other explanatione, which were proposed before or
after mine, may be seen in a paper by Ansrocht (Zeiochrtfl s
Ver-pl. Sproctf. 1851, p. 232). The suggestion that the genitive
