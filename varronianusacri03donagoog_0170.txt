L. 5: emens seems to be the locatire of e wordcom-oeus,
synonymous with manas, end designeting the aper publicar,
i. e. τὸ κοινόν. Per-um ᾱοῑπιηι molem siora--per dolum molam
mam. The proposition per-um seems to be a oomponnd like its

synonym aot-pert (12, doc). Iole homo-[oo] is perhaps hoo

eom-anam: eboc stands in this inscription for hanc or eum-ce.

L. 6: -bar amend. In Lepsius' transcript this is written as
one word3 but in the original there is s vacent space between
the two, and -kce is clearly the end of some mutilated word, the
beginning of which was broken off from the end of the preceding

line. Ammrd occurs ogein in this line, end also in the Gip- ἶ

pus Abellanae, 1. 17. It seems to be the sbl. of some noun.
Mommsen translates it coroa, end some such meaning ie re-
quired. At any rate, it governs o genitive in both clauses of
this comparative sentence. For moro isefeminine noun, as ap·
pears fronite abistive mmcd, l. 103 gen. pl. cymam, l. 24.
Consequently -Ῑσαε must represent the gen. sing. of some adjec-
tire egreeing with ῳ-ηιαε. Mommsen derives egr-roo from
egere, so that it means “ need cr business.” Huschke, who finds
Greek everywhere, refers the word to αἴχμη, end rendere it eoe-
trooerra’c, jurgium (dee osk. u. Sao. Gpr. p. 80). As umbraret} is
clearly imperati (cf. embrotur with imperator), and ss karieth
may be the genitive of some noun siguifying “pennissi0n” (cf.
eadm, χα-ν-δάνω, xorem, coreo, dcc), the whole passage will
mean: παρὰ negotii proprii cased, quam almep'ue imperati
aut permissi cased. Pr’er’r and piei in this line and the next are
the gen. end dot. of peb= quie. Itis supposed by several
scholnrs that dat in this line is another form of the preposition
de,· similarly dat castrii haflmed (1.8) is supposed to mean de
apro lrbero; dat siesse (l. 9) is rendered by de illm and dat
ciacc mmcd (l. 10) is de illa re (Fabretti, p. 288). If so de is to
dotasse-toral. ·

L. 8: hiltipold, ie. ne babeat: conf. ll. 11, 14, 173 eleo
pru-hepid (25) =proehibeot end pne-bt'puet (26) =proeha⁸buerit
Post poet is probably un error cf the engruver for pod port,
for pod=qaod signifies quando in l. 23; or we must omit the

former port as an unmeaning interpolation. Post-siah προσι- p

-bnc or post-cole: ciclo is the aecus. nect. pl. of the pronoun ³
esua, which we have olso in the Eugubine Tables, the -k, ·ko‚ ¹
