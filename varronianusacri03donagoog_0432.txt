are not maintained throughout all the tenses. The present

indicative has dropt the characteristic cn, except in the two cases χ

of aum and a‘aqoom. The sign of the first person singular is
also wanting in the perfect indicative, and in the futuras in do
and aro. The second person singular is represented by -aiu
every case bnt one-that of the perfect indicative, which substi-
tutes -sta'⁸ The third singular is always -t,· the first plural al·
ways enum the* second plural always -tt's, except in the perfect
indicative, when it is -oa, corresponding to the singular of the

¹same person3 and the third plural is always -nt, though this is

occasionally dropt in the third person plural of the perfect indi-
cative. The loss of the final t in the third person singularis
found both in the U mbrian forms hoba, fitia, εἰ, dre. for hoba,
ficet, ait, dre, and in the old Latin dede, dedra, dederi. We
have also in Umbrian coemam and hennae for conculcarent and
omnent. If we may judge from the -to, -tote of the imperative,
these person-endings must have been originally ablative·or causa-
tive inflexione ef the proncuns. The original form of the im·
perative suffia iu the singular number was -tool or -tad, which is
unequivocally an ablativo inflexion (above, Ghap. v111. ξ 8).

“ - In common Latin the imperative not only lost its personal affix

in the second singular, but even suffered an apocope of the crude

ferm in certain verbs, as duo aud sac. For da or dato we have χ

dt in cada, “give-here,” plural cette ,· and Ι have elsewhere
endeavoured to prove that the nearly synonymum med& must
be a similar form involving also the first persoual prononn (“ On
the Etymology of the Latin particle modo,” Troos. of the Philet.
Soc. 1854, pp· 97 sqq.).

The person-audinga of the passive verb present some difficul- Ῑ
ties to the inquiring philologist. In fact, only the third person, ἶ
singular and plural, seems to have been preserved free from ³

mutilation or suppression. The terminatione of the passive
should, according to the mles of sound philology, present them-
selves as inflexione or cases of the active person-endings (see

Nea Orotyluo, §348). If, then, we compare the active amat,
cotom, amore, with the corresponding passive forms, amabar, r
amane, amciter, we must conclude that r, connected with the 1
active form by a short vowel, e or a, is the sign of the passive ’
voice, and that this amounts to an inflexion of tlre active forn
