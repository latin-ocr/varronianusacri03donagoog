ἵ had no consonant j, the name of Jonas must have been pro·
nounced by them as Zanes. This god, whose four-laced statue
was brought from Falerii to Rome, indicated the sky, or ternplum, ἱ
with its four regions. When he appeared as diaspra, he repre·
sented the main regions of the templum—the dannanus end
the cordo. And as this augurial reference was intimately con-
nected with the arrangement os the gates in a city or in a camp ¹,
he became also the· god of gates, and his name ultimately signi-
fied “a gate'’ or “arohway.” Summanos, or semaam, was
the god of nightly thunders. The usual etymology is summos

· manium hut there is little reason for supposing that it is an
ordinary Latin word. As Amobius considers him identical with
Pluto¹, it seems reasonable to conclude that he was simply the
Jupiter Infernns; and as the Dtspater of the Tuscana was called
Moatra, and his wife Mania, we may conjecture that Murenae
was perhaps in Tuscan Zao-manus or Jupiter-bonas, which is
the common euphemiam in speaking of the infernal deities. The
connexion between the nightly thunders, which the ancients so
greatly secred, and the χθονίαι βρονταί, is obvious. Another
gloomy form of the supreme god was Ve-djus or. lhjovt‘a, who
seems to hare represented Apollo in his characteres the causer
of sudden death. The prefix Ve· is a disqualifying negative-
the name signifies “the had J upiter.'' He was represented as a
young man armed with arrows3 his feast was on the nones ot'
March, when an atoning sacrifice was offered up to him; and he
was considered, like Summanus, as another form of Pluto.

The second of the great Tuscan deities was Jono (Joviao or
Dynno), who was called Kupra and Thalna in the Etruscan

language. Now Kapro signifies “good’' as has been shown
ahore; and therefore Dec haspra is Deo bonu, the common
euphemiam for Proserpina. The name Thalna may be analyaed
with the aid of the principles developed above. The Etruecsns
had a tendency to employ the aspiratae for the tenues, where

with the god of rightly thunders in some forms ol' mythology. rt (lo-
