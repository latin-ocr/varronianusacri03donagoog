quc, as in cun-qroe and dau-qm (above, p. 236). But in deqotm,
as in the proposition cum, and the affix of the accusative and
locative case, the final m is merely the representative of a more

original a, and that quinque really stands for qurhtc is farther
shown hy the ordinal‚ which is quintas and not qaimptae. The

ordinal prooem is derived from the proposition proe, just as the
Greek πρῶτος comes from πρό. All the ordinale end in enus
(which is perhaps contained in octavus for octauum, nostru for
mmm), with the exception of medua, “ following,'' which
is merely the participle of aequor, aud of muna, qtmrtru, quimus,
antus, which represent the Greek *roe In tertius this ending is
lengthened by the qualitative or possessive -drrs, so that ter-tius
is a derivative of ter-tua, and the same is the caso in the Senserit
dvi-ttyoa tri-ttyoa, andin the Sclavenic ueriti, fem. hetdo. The
. Sclavenic relative lotororh exhibite a similar extension of a form
corresponding to κόπρος. By the side of duc we have ambo,

which is nearly synonymous with uterque. The distinctiones ν

these words is well known. While duo merely denotas an ag-
gregate of two individuale-the number “ two’‘-amho signifies
“both topother,'’ and uterque, “both tho one and the other.'‘
Of. the Greek ἆμφότερος and ἑκάτερος, Plat. lheaetct. p. 185 Β.
This is clear from such passages aa the following3 Ter. Adelph.

Onremm aqpam surpra portetur tu alterum,
Ego alterum: narn amtor curare propemodum
Reposcere illum est, quem dedisti.

“Iret both the one aad the other of aa look to ls1s own: for to
concern yourself with tou repetitor is almost to demand hack
again the boy whom you gave me.” Auson. ΕΡ. 91: “ vis ambos
ut amem? si diligit atraque vellcm'' “ Do you wish meto love
bort metirer? If hou tle one and the other loves me, Ishonld
he glad to do so.” Hence it is clear that, as Dsderlein says
(Lat.Et.u. Spa.1v.349), απιόο regards the two as two holcen
but rateque as two iateprcl unium and the former corresponds
to ἄμφω, the latter to ἑκάτερος, ond both in different cases
to ἀμφότερος. The separability of the two constituent unita
in uterque is farther shown by the fact that this word may have
either a singular or plural verb, whereas ambo always takes the
plural. It is worthy of remark, as the two words aro osten
