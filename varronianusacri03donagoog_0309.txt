The labiels consist of three mutes end the liquid Μ. The
regular changes of the lobial mutes, in the principal languages
cf the Indo-Germanic family, have heen thus indicated by J ames
(himin, to whom we owe the' discovery of a most important law
(Deuteehe Gramm. Ι. p. 584¹), which may >be stated thus in its
application to all three orders of mutes:

121&th InGothtc. holzffissh

Mediaf correspondet to Teum& md to Aepirafe.
Aepirote „ „ Medici „ Tenuis.
Tenuis „ ,‚ Aepr'rote ‚‚ Medici.

This law, applied to the lebials only, may be expreseed in the
following table: “

beginning with Ρ, and no H. G. words beginning with F.

The second column is supported as follows: Initiels-Wao
