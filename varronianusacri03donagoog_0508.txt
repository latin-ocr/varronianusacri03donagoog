this passage, compared with that of the former, that relipsh
means not only the scrupulous observance of religious obliga
tions, but the lasting curse or remorse, which, as a punishment,
waits on those who violate the sanctity of divine worship. This
feeling may, as the former passage shows, be expiated, atoned,
or removed by the performance of suitable ritas, or the guilt Ξ
may be so heinons that 'no reconciliaticn can take place between ἒ
the offender and his conscience3 end thus we find—in the third
passage tu which I have adverted, (c) Philipp. 1. 6, §132 “au
me censetis, P. O, decreturum fuisse, ut parentalia cum supplica·
tionibus miscerentur ut remansissem rn rempublicam
inducerentur?”—that a state would be involved in an ἄγος, or
pollution, which no καθαρμοί could wash dway, if funcreal sacri-
fices in honour of the departed were mixed up and confused with
public thanlrsgivings to the immortal gods.
From all this it appears that the formation in -o[n] brings
the mere abstract noun, from which it is derived, intopa more
concrete reference, so that the meaning is rather the result of the
verb's action than the aetionitself. This is the signification also l
⁴ of Greek nonns in -ων, -cvoe, many of which, as λειμών, denote
some object or thing. The most important, and perhaps the
least understood of these Greek nonns is αἰών, vihich denotes not
only an unlimited extension in time, which is one meaning of
del, bnt also present existence, or existence for the time'being,
as in ὁ κρατῶν ἀεί, “ whoever happens to be in power’' (AEscla
Prone. 973); thus αἰών may signify not only an age or etemity, χ
but alnotho present life, es opposed to the future, which is Ἴ
sometimes its meaning in the New Testament‚ and the 'misfing ²
generation of a family for the time being, as opposed to the Ἴ
series of pereat, which make up the whole succession or con ’
tinuance of a racc (see the note on the Antip. 580, p. 179).
From reficio we have the adjective sciapodas& and tha
occurrence of the ¹same form in derivatives from 'nouus in -io
as mma-osas from aerumna, plcriocas from ylario, lacunosae
from lusoria, dra, tends to confirm tho 'supposition that the ,
, nonu in -a'o is an extension of the noun in -ic. We find adjec-
tIves in -oem from other crude forms, as dodona, libcih'a-osos,
- and we may conclude that iu these cases also the intermediate
· form is the genitive in -a'on The forms iu -tr‘vas, mentioned
