ofa misunderstanding as to the logical intention of the phrase,
the perfect subjunctive in Latin has been supposed to be merely
a future indicative referring to completcd action. The following
comparison will show that there is no use of the tense now under
consideration, which may not be referred to some parallel em-
plcyment of the Greek conjunctive or optative aorist.

lpaheas· ,debis ·
ahebrs
d. ἐάν τι mir, δώσειςεεί quid habueris, dabis.
c. el τι ἔχοις, διδοίης dv = si quid habeas, deu.

d. εἴ τι σ’χοίης, δοίης ἅν =si quid habueris, dederis.

If in thc second and fourth cases timueris and vsiccioris arc

pulllrjunctive or potential‚ the sams explanation must apply to the
ο owrng:

a. ἐάν τι ἔχῃς, δώσειςπεί quidj

c. si plone occidimus, ego manebus mula eou'trb fuero, “if
we have altogether fallen, I shall have been (i. e. I shall
prove in the result, ’γενοίμην ἄν) a destruction to all my
friends.”

h. si perper, aduro, “if you go on, I shall have departed
(i. e. I shall go at once, ἀπέλθοιμ’ ἅν).”

c. tc inuita mulcerem epo coiaco pucros, “do you invite
the ladics3 after that, when you have done so, Ι shall be
found to have sent for the boys (cr) μὲν τὰς «γυναῖκας
κάλει· ἐγὼ &scabrositate μεταπεμψαίμην).”

That the difference betwueu the subjunctive present (Ο. Ι.)
and this subjunctive perfect (C. ΙΙΙ.) is one ostense only, might
be shown by numberless examples3 thus we have (Plaut. ibicum.
11. 4, 137=538): mopsi cpcye dhus, si omnic ce mc audive-
ris, and(111. 1, 21=621): quoi nsum quom rem urendos, sius
muci cura mica, where wc have an spodosis comesponding
to the Greek present optative with dv, preceded by a protasis
containing an equivalent to the optative aorist. It is a mere
assumption on the part of some grammarians that there is any
differcnce of usage between the forms of the first person in -ro
or rim. The choico of one form or the other is a mere matter
of euphony, and they aro both equally subjunctive or potential
in their nature. Thus wa find in a hortativa or deliberative
sense: hacc alt‘quaasom &sumsero (Trinium. 111. 1, 25=625),
