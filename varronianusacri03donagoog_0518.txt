same class with the Greek patronymica in dm, ‚where the second
pronominal element appears under the form of an approximate

dental sibilant (Nero Orat. §262).

The most common extensiones the third pronominal clement i

is its reduplication under the forms t÷ n or a ÷ t, the latter eom·
bination being by far the most usual. With regard to other
forms into which the pronoun enters under the type t, it is not
always easy to say whether this is a corruptiones ty, or merely
the expression of the objectiva word. Thus we have seen that
in t÷r there is something more than the third clement extended
hythe addition of r. Itis probable‚ however, that in such affines
as -ti-maa and tiana we have merely the third clement in

the first syllable ; compare the Senserit paroya-tadmor, dyas-tow ,
and earnm, in which the dental appears unaffeeoed by any

foreign clement, with ea-ti-moa, lapi-tienne, orm-tiam, dea-ta- l
rma& dicar-oua (from diuo), lto-dieram (from lto-dius, of. ¹
nn-dias); and aci-tuaene with the passive participle toci-tart
We come to a similar conclusion by comparing the older spell-
ing of theodin, as in opt-tamea, with the change in τύπω p
μενεπῧπτ-ο-μες, vota-mua, dietmar, whence it appears that r
the a is not a vocalized consonant, but a mere change of articu- .

very little, so far aa the meaning of the affix is eoncemed, l
whether the dental syllable is referred to the second clement

or the third. This has been shown in the analysis of the third ,

consider it as made up oi to÷ra‚ or regard it as a correptior Ἴ
