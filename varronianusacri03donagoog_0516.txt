enemy, i. e. to the rear of the pretorium. The augur then,
standing with his back to the enemy, surreyed really the rear-
half of the camp. Consequently the limes &cumanus from him
, was the rear-wall, and as he counted the gate behind him as the

pretoria with reference to the pretorium where he stood, and ,

the porta principalia dewtra and ιιιιὶιιτα those to his own right
end left, so he called the gate in front of him the decanam,
because it stood in the tenth line of tents from his station, which
was the decumano eia, just as the road between the 5th and oth
lines of tents, where the quoestorr'um stood, was called the qaor-
tana cia (Festus, p.257; Liv. XLI. c. 2, ad fla.)¹. The reference to
the locative in the nouns in -accs is shown still further hythe
relation between these noune and their extensione in ιιι-εὑ.
These derivatives ere either formed directly from their primi-
tives, as protracte, “that which belongs to or grows in the
meadcw'’ (proto-en ερναι-ίιι, in a heavier form μαι-ιιι), or else
they involve some noun already formed upon the locatiwe, aa
emesan-es from Rorrrarrus. “ In genere‚’' says Ruhnken (od
Stret. Geso. ξ 37, p. ¹58), “ adjectiva, quae in eruo exeunt, de·
signant res hominesque, qui suntin aliqua regione, sed aliunde
originem habent. Rornarrcs, qui Romae natus est; homonymus,
qui Romae degit: Siculus, qui in Sicilia ortus est; sextense
qui incolit Siciliam, aliunde ortus: v. Fest. v. Ocrimhienerhet

in 'Iraltt'rs et Ἰταλιώτης, Σικελός et Σικελιώτης, &er v. Ammo- l
nium in his vocibus et ibi Ol. Valckenar.’' 'I'his is a correct ¹

l statement of the fact, but it does not explain the formation of

the secondary nouus in caath. As Ἰταλιώτης, tm, are formed ἵ

from nouus in -ια (Nero Orat. ξ 259), eo we always find that, if
there are co-existing derivatives in -rme and -ca-ar’a there is an
intervening form in -a'a. Thus from chpanus we have Hie-
panio, and from this again Hz‘sparrienatb as from the locatire
Hrhpcres'ccc. Accordingly, we may infer that martum,
which is the true form, eomes from an intervening Romam as

Quemnam porta was also called theporto ' because it
was nearest qo the quoertortum (niv. x. 32, xrx1v. 4 ). On the whole ·
