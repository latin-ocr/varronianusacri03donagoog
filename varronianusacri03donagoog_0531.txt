plough, which Virgil tenus a euml (Georp. 1. 174), it may

have been also a designation ¹for something corresponding to

mese side-pisces in the wheeled vehiole. Imay remark, in
passing, that the eracl window, in Gothic architecture, was un·
doubtedly so called from its projecting like the human ear from

the side of a building. The old spelling shows this. Thus we

find in sn ancient Msn “The Lords always eat in Gothick

Halls, at the high table or orea'lle (which is a little room at the

upper end of the hall where stands a table) with the iolks at the

side tablcs;'’ in accordance with which we find in Matthcw of

Paris (op. Daeonq. s. v.): “ut non in infirmaria, sed selrrsim in

οτίοῑο, monachi infirmi carnem comederent’' Now it is well ss
known thet oreille is a representative of aeneadas. So that the ss
oriolum or “ oriel” is the “ ear-window’' or projecting ohamber ⁴
used lor privacy and retirement.

(c) Accilium oompounds arc when two verbs oome together,
aud the second helps the former either in a predication of time,
or by introducing a modification of meaning or reference3 thus
we have: emendantem-firi, oen-do=oeaam do, oca-eowe-
παθη co, aroeeo0=aooedere sino,¹treme-Jhc1o=tremere sacch, &c.;
and to the same class belong all the tenses in dom and -ho, -oi
and -ocram “

(d) Possessive oompounds are when the first part denotes the
manner, in which the thing, denoted hythe last word, is pos·
sesead by the subject, to which the whole oompound is referred
either as predicate or epithet; thus wc have: aheno-horbruc,
alti-sonas, mmai-pen mapa-animae, in which the first part is
a declinable word ; and afflatis, concors, affatus, benficus, iner-
mis, dimonis, elingere, in which the first part is an uninfleeted
particle: in both cases the possessive adjective, constituted hy
the whole oompound, involves s determinative oompound, which
is medo moveable, so as to agree with different substantives.

¹ Modern editors read earam, but itis difficolt to see why carm
should be applicablo to a plough, when thesemo word with an assimi-
lation is corsoidered inapplicable. lt appears to mo that the socondnry
word is more suitoble to the metaphor than tho direct verbal. Resides,
itis clear frum the verb torqueo that the plough itself, not its motion, is
hore alluded to in ‘⁶ eunus a terpo torqueat hanff ⁴
