§sl rna narra consonatione. 455

weakened forms of original verbs in which the vowel i appeared3
and thia inferenoe is confirmed by their etymology: for there
can be no doubt that peto is identical with the Gothic btly'aa,
Greek πείθω = wid-yo, whence πτ-ωχὸς end the Italian pit-oooo.
Now if the primary meaning of this root is “to fall down’'
and “make an inclination,” like the Hebrew ἳῐζῖξ, “ to make a

reaching towards another,‘' so that the root will be contained in

pe[d]-a, arim-e, πέδ-ον, sotor, “leot” the present must heve · Δ

required the strengthening observed in πείθωεπίθ-ῃω, and
presumed in peto :pet-yn. It is also clear that rodo is only
another form of ruyth, which has passed inte rude ,· compare
the Gothic raolte=“fremitus,” with the Greek ῥόθος, ῥοθεῑν,
ῥύζειν, γρύζειν, &e Several of the consonant verbs strengthen
the root in the present tense end its derivatives by a nesal
insertion analogous to the Senserit annectam but this insertion
· is never retained in the perfect, if this tense ia or was formed by
reduplication3 thus we have praa-po, puptyi, rtem-po, νᾶμ’,
freno-po, frtyo', tun-do, tetoldi, aci-n-do, acidi, dec. The same
rnle applies to a, when it is appended to the root, for in this cese
also it appears to be inconsistent with reduplication, not only in
the Greek and Latin, but also in their elder sister the Senserit,
andin the Solanonian, which fnrnished the Pelasgian clement to
both of them. Thus we have ola-domi, but opsoni ‚· δίδωμι,
τίθημι, iamper, but ζεύγ-νυμι, διίμ-νημι, irc-vs‘epat3 πί-πτω
for πι-πέτω, bnt πίτ-νω; bibo, but πί-νω; and, es we shall
see, sper-no, but epra-oi, contem-no, but contemp-ei. In Scla-
venian there is a particular class of v‘erbs, which the grammarians
call semel-factive, andin which this no is the distinctive mark.
As then the reduplication clearly denotes iterative or continuous
action, we must conclude that a is in these cases the pronominsl
element denoting separation and distance, which is opposed to the
idea of ebiding presence connected with that of continuance.
Whereas in those cases in which the perfect formation retains the
-o, as in jonyo, yiraxi, sisapor, fimetoe rora, tre, we may infer
that the a is merely euphonic, er intended to express, in con-'
junctien with the guttural, the sonnd of the Semiticp (see
Repert of tlte Brt'tialr Aaaooe'atioa for 1851, p. 148). Most of
the Greek verbs in -τω exhibit the τ- as a pronominal adjunct
of the same kind with the -v- which hes just been mentioned:
