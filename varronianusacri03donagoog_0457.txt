future of the Latin verb, the desiderative aud furuue participle
have been formed by the addition of the future r=s and the
desiderative ri=ai, not to the crude form of the verb, but to
the verbul in -tru, so that the desiderative is deduced imme·
diatcly from tho future participle in -tur·uc or stom the noun
of agency in -εον (above, p. 427).

We have seen above (ξ 4) that the form fuerim =facarin is
really a subjunctive tense of the usual kind derived from the
perfect indicative fiai=fucaa As, however, the first person ie
occasionally written fuero, just as sim=eoim or erim is short·

ened into cro, it has been common among grammarians to ima· .

gine two tenses as distinctas ero and sira But this view is
represented under two different forms; for while the older gram-
mars make siverim andfirero two tenses of the subjunctive mood,
the former being perfect, and the latter future, the more modern
writers on the subject increase the confusion by referring the
latter, as a futurum exactam, to the indicative meod, while the
former retains its place as perfect subjunctive. These, who have
had any thing to do with the business of teaching the Latin
language, need nothe told that a young and thoughtful student
will not derivo much edification from the doctrine that ficerat is
both iadr'cdticc aud aufy'uamm, both past andfirturc. And those
who are conversant with the lrighcr kind of philology, know
that, while suem andfircrim are merely euphonic distinctions, all
the other persons, having only one set of meanings, are neces-
sarily inflexione of the same form. Even the quantity of the
plural ¹iu a proof that the tense is subjunctive. For while we
have invariably aimus, earo, we have no authority for a short
penultima in the first and second persons plural of tho perf. subj.‚
and several instanccs of the ι’ being long, as Catull. v. 10: seoc-

Mil, Gi. 862: daber-ttae With regard to the signification of
this perfect subjunctive, itis clear that, ss it is formed from
the perfect indicative just as the present subjunctive is formed
from the present indicative, it must exhibit the same modification
of meaning. Now dicum=drb=yam means “there is a proba-
