consistently explained in this way, hut we found that some peon·
liarities of etymology and syntax were at onos illustrated by a
reference to the same standard of comparison. So that, on the
whole, every available resource of grammar and philology teuds
to confirm and reconcile the otherwise divergent and eontra·
dictory statements of ancient history3 and the Etruscans may
now without any inconsistency claim both the Tyrrheno-Pelas·v

§ 12. General remarks on the absorptiou or evuaoecence os
the old Etruscan Luayucye.

It only remains thet Ι should make a few remarks on the ⁸
absorption or evanescence of the old Etruscan language. When
we see so much thetis easily explained3 when, iu fact, there is
no great difficulty in dealing with any Etruscan word which has
come down to ns withan interpretation or clue to its meaning3
and when we are punzled only by inscriptions, which are in
themselves mere fragments, made up in a great measure of
proper names, deformed by a rude, precatione, and osten incon·
sistent orthography, and mutilated by, we know not how many,
conventional abbreviatione, it is sufficiently evident that the
striking differenoes between the Etruscan and the other ancient
dialects of the peninsula were not such asto take the langnage ·
out of the Indo-Germanic family, and that while these differences
affected only an inconsiderable ingredient in the old Etruscan,
the main portion of the language must have approximated very
closely to the-contignous end surrounding idioms. Otherwise,
we should be obliged to ask, where is the bulk of that language
which was spoken by the auoestors of Maecenas? We talk of
dead langnagcs3 but this variety of human speech should seem
to he not only dead, hut huried, and not only huried, but sunl<
beueath the earth iu some necropolis, into which no Galassi or
Campanari can dig his way. The standard Italian of the
present day is the offspring of that Latinity which was spoken ·
by the Etrusco-Romana but we find no hace of ancient her·
barium in auy Tuscan writer. Surely it is a fair infereuce, that
while the Raetian clement, introduced into the northern cities
