the evidence of affinity furniehed by the fact that the words three

funemal character, are translated at ouoe by the Icelandic syno-
nyme treys' and eut, both signifyiug ‘⁸ grief ” or “sorrow'' If
we had only this fact we should be iuduced by it to eeelr for

Europe and the obscure fragments of the old Etruscan.

It has been already mentioned that the inscription on the
right leg of the sitting figure of the boy of the Museo Graziani

ended with the word over. There is another sitting figure of ,

the seme kind, which was found at Tarquinii in the yeer 1770,
and which had an inscription on the left erm (Amaduzzi, Alphe
betam veter. Etruscorum. p. hum). Of this arm unfortunately
only the shoulder remains, but the mutilated fragment of the
inscription contains thie same word coer. As the word occurs in

ed. 2). And ae the female figure belonging to the Mercheee
Obiao is supposed to represent Proserpine, it ie proposed to read

also on e monument beginning with (e)oa suthe· (Vermiglioli,
p. 1³1,l. 6, ed. 2), which is therefore of a funereal character,

necessary to alter thetexte of the inscriptions, Ι should be

adjectives or participles expressive of sorrow, or that they am
slightly different forms of the seme word. In either case the
old Teutonic comesto our assistance. On the supposition of two
