it by the arguments which I have just adducad; but if we ·
remember that the original s 01 many Roman words was 001
changed into 01111 01001 110 411 century Δ. U. c. (above, ch. vn.

occurs in fragments 01 Ennius), and paura-raa (which is found
in Plautus, Mostellaria, 1. 2, 17 3 Poeaalua, 010147), as a distinct
confirmation 01 110 theory (compare 0100 011ἒο -· dcam, or daem,
with such forms as da'eapa'ter, diurnata, 110-«1010000, dre). And
here again the analogy 01 110 genitive becomes applicable, 00
will be 0000 below (ξ 5). Τ10 pronouns 0100 supply a purtial

confirmation 01 110 above induction3 for though iu common ,

A'gain, in regard 10 the accusative plural, which in all the
above instances ends iu -a preceded by a long vowel, we must
infer that -s is the termination 01 110 plural 00 0001, 100ιο con·

posing that the long vowel indicates the absorption 01 some oon· ’

110 only supposition which explains 011 110 phenomaua Lat us
take the Greek, Latin, Senserit, and Gothic 1000010 0 particular

other forms is the supposition that they were originally identioal

aceruative siugul'ar 01 synonymous words in these four languagea.
The plural 01 110 Gothic aulfo-n is simply vulsa-na, whereas all
the other forms strengthen the iinal ,vowel 01 110 crude form,
