The name of the Umbriam, the most northerly of the indi·
genous Italicus, leads to some other considerations of great im-
portauce. It can scarcely be doubted that in their northern as
well as their southern settlements the Lithuaniens were a good
deal intermixed with Celto-Finnish tribes in the first instance,
und subjected to Sclavenisn influeuces afterwards. That this wss
the case with the Lithuanians, we leam from their authentic and
comparatively modern history. 'Phe proper names cited by Zeuss
(p. 229) show that there was a Celtic ingredient in the popule-
tion of Raetia end Noricum. It appears, too, that in Italy there
was asubstratum of Celts before the Lithuanians arriwed there;
this is expressly recorded of the Umbrians by M. Antonius and
Bocchus (apud Solio. c. 2) und by Servius (od Very. AEaett ΧΠ.
753), and the fact is clearly indicated by the name of the country,
Umbreb, end its principsl river Umbro. If the oldest inhabit-
ants of this country were Celtic, they must have been en offshoot
of the Celtic racc which occupied the contiguous district of Ligu·
ria². Now not only are the Ambroues ssid to have been a Celtic
rece (Ambrones, says Festus, fierunt qous quodem Gallica),
but this was ulso the generic neme of the Ligerim (σφᾶς γὰρ
αὐτοὺς οὕτως ὀνομάζουσι κατὰ γένος Aiyoec, Plut. Ve't. Marii,
c. xix). Whetever weight we may attach to the statement in
Festus, that they were driven from their original settlements by
an inundation of the sea, we cannot soil to see the resemblance ·

fairly inserted that it was to them a significant term, aud msy therefore
be taken ss a merl oi sffinity: no lodo-Germanic philologer will deny
that the hithueniaus and Germane were cognate rsoes.

¹ Mr. Ellis, who maintains (Contributionr to tlte Ethnopraphy os Italy
aad θηωε, houd. less) that the Aboriginel Italicus were chiefly Celtic,
but pertly Pinnish, and allows thet the Umbrians were Celtic, contende
that the Ligurinas (pp. ls sqq.) were s branch oi the Finns, add sup·
port· his opinion by resoniug bodium or bodonem to the Lapponio
mod(ow) unck :suado eorem. Ihave used the eompounds celto-Fin-
nish and celto-Turanisn to indicate the mixture of these ethnic elemento
ln tho early populatiou of Europe, und 1 do not dcoy thet thero may
heve been Finnish ingrediente in the Ligurian ηοω but 1 think thet
tho reasons giren in the text prove that they were mainly Celtic.
