or Ombricans in the north, and of Opicans or Oscans in the
’ south. When it was intermixed with Sclavonic elements to
about the same extent as the Lithuanians or Old Prnssians in
the north of Europe, this Low-German populaticn became
known as Latina and Sabines. And the Etr-uacans or Rasena
were a later and uninfected importation of Low Germane heah
from the north, who conquered and were partly absorbed into
the pure Tyrrheniam, or Pelasgo-Sclavonians to the right of the
Tiber.

In giving this general skctch of the ingredients which com-
posed the population of ancient Italy, Ι omit all reference to the
Greek colonists, who retained their languagc and a distinct na-
tionality in numerous settlements along the coast, and actually
gave the name of Graecia Magno (ἡ μεγάλη Ἑλλάς) to the south-
eastern part of the Peninsula. Like the colonies in Sicily, these
Greeks belong in every sense to their mother country, and
Italian ethnography is not more concerned with them than with
the inhabitants of Attica and Laconia. The Greeks of Cuma,
from whom the Romans derived their alphabet, and perhaps
many other features of their early civilisaticn, only anticipated
the infinences, which subseqnent intercourse with the Greeks of
the mother country produced on the whole texture of the lan·
guage and literature of Rome.

§ 2. Tho LATIn’s-a composite tribe.

The investigations of Niebuhr and others have made it
sufficiently certain that the Pelasgians formed a very important
clement in the population of ancient Latium. This appears not
merely from the primitive traditione, but also, and more strongly, '
from the mythology, language, and architecture of the country.
It has likewisc been proved that this Pelasgian population was
at an early period partially conquered by a tribe of mountaineers‚
who are called Oceano, and who descended on Latium from the
basina of the Nar and the Velinus. The influencc of these
foreign invaders was most sensibly and durahly felt in the
langnage of the country3 which in its earliest form presente
phenomena not unlike those which have marked the. idiom
spoken in this island since the Norman conquest. The words
