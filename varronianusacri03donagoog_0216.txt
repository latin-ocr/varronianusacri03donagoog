Max. 11. 4, 43 Tertull. de Spect. v. The derivation from the l
ethnic neme Ipdiue is of course e mere fancy. It does not, ,
however, seem improbable thet, ss the ermed dences ss well *
as the clownish hnffooneries os tho Romans were derived from
Etruria, so the neme, which designsted these ss jokers end
pleyers (ludiones), wss Ehuscen also, like the other name
ther, which denoted the imitative ector. If so, the word
ludus was also of Tuseen or Pelasgien origin. Now this word
lodus is admirably adopted to express ell the functione of the
'lhrscsn ludio. Itis connected with the roots of loedo (comp.

· crede, ooedo), lotbopoc, λίζω, λάσθω, (-- wallo), Hesych.). Gon·
sequently‚ it expresses on the one hand the amusement efforded
by the gesticulations oi the ludet (σχηματίζεται ποικίλως εἰς
phora, Appien, u. s), and on the other hond indicates the
innocent brandishing of wespons by the armed ludio ss com-
pared with the use of arms in actual waslare. This letter
sense wss preserved by ludos to the lest, es it signilied the ἶ
school in which the gladiatore phryed cr fenced with woodcn }
foils (redeo) preparetory to the bloody encounters of the arena.
Thet the ludtbnes were Thecans eren in the classical ogeis
clear from Plautus, Ourcelsb, 1. 2, 60 sqq.: “ptereli, heus,
pessuli, vos saluto lubens—fite coust mee lodii detmari,- soib-
etio, dbsecr0‚ et mittite istinc foras,” punning on the resem-
blance of pessuli to the presules ol these Tuscen dencers (see
Non. Marc. c. 111. de Doctorum Indcpine p. 783, Gottosr.).
Mr. Ellis compares the Irish luth, “ nimble‚'’ “active”
which hsrmonizes with the dences et least of the Tuscan
ludiones.

Mna, the Tuscan port, probably got its neme from the helf-
moon shape of the horbcur. See Pers. vt. 7, 83 Strabo, v.
p. 2223 Martial, xm. 30. The Tuscsn spelling was perhaps
Losna (= ΙΛω-πα), which is found on apotere (sec Mttller,
Etmslr. 1. p. 294). With this we may compare the Irish
labne, “ fleme.”

Manus or Manio, “ good.’' Apparently e Tuscen word; st eny
rate, the manes were Tusoan divinities. Fest. p. 146, sv.
Mensem Serv, ad AEn.1.139,111.63. So omre mnus, in
the Salian song, was creator bonus. Fest. p. 122, s. v. Matrem
