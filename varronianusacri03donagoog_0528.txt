tion to κρούω that Agragantum, Gaesao, and stupae do to
Ἀκράγας, Κνωσσός, and Πρόκνη ; and I detect the same verbio
arguenti-pm, which means “to knoclr against something?

ness; a meaning also seen iu its participle arpenas, which sig·
nifies “made to ring,'' “making a distinct chrill noise,” “ loud,”
‘⁶ clear-soundiug,’' “significant'’ “ expressive,” or, with reference
to the secondary but most common meaning of arpeo, the partici-

ple deuotes “brought to the proof, thoroughly tegffly’ ιι wmd'n ,

“ accurate ;” similarly crpameatum means ‘⁴ that which makes a
substance ring, which sounds, examines, tests, and proves it”

ξ 11. Β. Ootnpoaitt’cn. Debet-imitation of Compound Worda.

The proper distinction between a compouud word and the
apparently compounded form consisto in the fact, that the former
is an union oi two or more words, ol which the last only is
inflected, sc that the preceding crude forms remain in a con·
structor subordinate state* whereas the mere juxta-position, or
apparently compounded term, is made up of separable elementa,
the inflexione of which are retained. Thus in euch words as
magnanimus, aedffiw, we have entirely new compouuds ; for the
former is an adjective made up from the ablative ol quality, so
that mapnonimue=ia qui crayae animo est; and the latterisa
derivative from a compouud adjective ωάῂῖοιιε, which involves
the whole predication oedemfocw. On the other hand, the com·
position is only apparent in rea-pablico, “the commonwealth,”
jusjurandum, “an oath,’' parth-peritas, “a lawyer,” animadverto ¹
:animam adverto, “ to pay attention to,” “ to take strict notice
¹ of,” “ to punish,” dcc. That these are not compouuds, but
merely juxta-positione of separable elemento, is clear from the
fact that, in those which are in direct agreement, both parts may
be inflected throughout, as reipublcboe,jare7jarando, and all may
be separated by particles, asin rec vero publica, jure layum
peritos. There is no doubt, however, that these parathetic
structurcs may pass into regular compouuds, in the course of

long usage. Thus frpm the phrase aesque for cs aemche, “one
