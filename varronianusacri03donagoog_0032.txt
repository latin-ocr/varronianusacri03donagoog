Dauniam and other tribes settled in the south-east, and gave
their name to the country3 they also extended themselves to
the west, and became masters of the country from the bay of
¹Terracina upwards to the Tiber. In this district they bore the ⁰
well-known names oi Volsci and AEqsi, names still connected
with the primary designation of the aborigines:

A more important invasion was that which was occasioned
by the pressure of the Sabinas on au Oscan people settled in
the mountaius between Reate and the Fucine lake. These iu-
vaders came down the Anio, and conquered the Pelasgians of
northern latium. The name &aaut given to these conquerere
in the old legende of Latium is supposed to refer to the tradition
that they left their home iu pursuanoe of the vow of a Sacred
Spring (Ver Somne). For itis said that, when the Sabellicus
found their population more thau their narrow territory would
support, they devoted to the Gods every creature born in a cer-
tain year, aud when twenty years had clapsed, the cattle were
sacrifioed or redeemed‚ and the young men were compelled

’ to expatriate themselves and find a new settlement at the

expense of their neighbours¹. According to the legende these
&moni were gnided to their new abodes by the animal, which
represented the God to whom they had been dedicated². 'Phua
the Sabellicus, who conquered Picenum, were led by a wood-
. pecher (pr'cus)⁸ ; those who conquered Samnium were conducted
by an ox (vitulus)⁴; those who conquered Hirpinum were con-
ducted by a wolf (birpus)³; the same animal figures in the tra·
ditione of Latium aud Rome3 and, as we shall see in the next
chapter, the wolf is also the sacred animal of the cognate
Lithuaniaus of the North. The chief seat of the Sacranians,
who conquered Northem Latium, seems to have boen Alba, the
Alp-ine or mountain-city, where they dwelt under the name of

Prisci Latini “ancient Latius ;'’ being also called Onesi, a name
