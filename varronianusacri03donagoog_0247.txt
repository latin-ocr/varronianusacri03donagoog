as an auxiliary affix to verbs, in the same wey 00 -do and -so =
raino are used 10 Latin, -do 10 Gothic, and 1010 10 Old Norae

that the Etruscan agrees with the 10110, Gothic, and Osoan, in

the Old Norse in the use ol the auxiliury lata, which probably

expect a similar coincidence in regard to the eusiliury ao=sr⁸ac
Now it will be shown 10 the proper place thet the isolated form

that care-ari would be quite equivalent 10 care-tusce. The root
