These remeius of the ΧΠ. Tables, though referring to an
early period of Roman history, are merely quotations, and as
such less satisfactory to the philological antiquar-y than monn-
mental relies even of a later date. The oldest, however, of these
authentic documenta is not earlier thau the second Samnite war.
It isa certatus-consultum, “which gives to the Tiburtinas the
assurance that the senate would receive as true and valid their
justificatior in reply to the charges against their fidelity, and
that it had given no credit, even before, to these charges’'
(Niebuhr, ΕΒ. 111. p. 310, orig. p. 264, tr.)¹. The inscription
was engraved on a bronze table, which was found at Tivoli in
the sixteeuth century, near the site of the Temple of Hercules.
About a hundred years ago it was in the possession οἳ the Bar-
beriui family, but is now lost, at least, Niebuhr was unable to
discover it, though he sought fer it in all the Italian collectione,
into which the lost mensures of the house of Barberini were
likely to have found their way. Niebuhr’s manscript (from
Gruter, p. 499), compared with Hanbold's (Mouwnaata Lapulab,
p. 81), is as follows.
