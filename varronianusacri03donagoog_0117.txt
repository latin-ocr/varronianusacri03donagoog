“the waste” (aare. f. Varpl. Sprjl 1. p. 33); but it 'appears
much more reasonable to compare these words with the Hebrew
0319, in which ease the affix re will be connected with a word
‚denoting “flowing:'’ of. tama with emerando (above 5 11).
(d) The Hebrew Πξί gives ns the root rep, “ to reach out,'’

with the prepositional affix ba, from atti, as fully ss the
Latin precor, proc-oa, Senserit prot-ettam, dcc. (a) Itis
only in the Pelasgian δολιχὸς, the Sclavonic alcippe, and the
Latin indulpea that we find a complete reprodnction of the

Semitic 557'3. (f) As the impersonal use ofdebeo nearly accords

with that of oportet, and as the latter is manifestly connected
with opas (Doderlein, Lot. Spa. a. Et. v. 324), it may be after
all more reasonable to connect dab-eo with ⁶the important root
dod, “a euitable time” (Polish), dola-ro, “good” (Polish and
Bessicae), which furnishcs us with one of the most remarkable
instantes of a connexion between the Sclavonian and Semitic lan·
gunges (cf. the Hebrew 250 dect, and the Arebic λὰ, debr),

than to fall back upon either of the favourite derivatione srom
aeream or detibeo. The adjective astte differs so entirely in
meaning and application from the verb debeo, to which it is re·
ferred, that I cannot concede the identity of origin. As there is
reason to believe that the termination cite is connected with tho
substantive verb fio (written bo in the agglutinata forms), a refer-
ence to the usage of mm and ‹Ia-fio would best explain the origin
and meaning of de-bdlr'a How the sense of “owing'’ or “obliga-
tion'’ borne by dab-ao is connected with that oi “ fitnees,'’ “good-
nesc‚’¹ and “ propriety,” may bc scen at once by an examination
of anch idioma, as δίκαιός εἰμι τοῦτο ποιεῖν, “Iam bound to do
this,” εἰ μὴ ἀδικῶ, “Iought,‘’ dcc. (p) A comparison of deri and
χθές enables us to, see that the Latin hamus and the Greek
χαμαί must meet in the root of χθαμινλός. This combined
form is therefore the Pelasgo-Sclavonic original, and ae such wc
recognize it in the kothem of the Carvetn’ inscription. Now

this again is ancer approximation tc the Hebrew flQ'th. (Ιι) 'she
Roman use of repet), dia-1⁹90, dre, in reference to roed-making,is
the best explanation of the obvious connexion between the Rus·
sian doroya and the Hebrew ΤΠ, in which the initial dental must
