extenuated i=yr thus suabu=scrib=yaa will be legitimately
formed from corabo, aota=aot=ya=eotia, will properly corre-
spond to τιμή, &a in Greek, and ιο amici-teir, &c in Latin. We
may also compare advocandum-yae with advenio. That
such aa extenuation is possible is shown by th'c transferenoe ol
ζώνη, &c into rond, dec. (above, p. 350). We have also seen
that the affix ι’ lies more or less hid in some nouus of the third

deciensiom and especially in participles and adjectivae (above, ’

p. 358). This ie particularly the case with the forms in ιιι-ι οι·
eti-e, aud we may compare the affix -ta'a or -tus, in pomula, “a
destroying,’' ces-tis,'“a covering,” potua, ιιο(1ιὶιι1ιίιις,”ορίνὶ·
tes, “a brcathing‚” with the Greek noune in -σις, -τις, and -τύς,
as πρᾶκ-σις, “a doing”=rrpa1c⁴rdc, φά-τις, “a speaking‚’' dcc
Το the same class we must refer the participial adjectives in
-ιιιιο, as cupidus=cupecut=a candi-dus=candcas, dre. (Nero Oret.
§265). Nouns in -su from a verbm-root, such aa fhoca, syron-sa,
ton-sa, are really femininae ol the passive participle, which pro
perly ended in -tus Perhaps the only nouns cithia class which
really correspond ιο Greek forms, like potae, δόξα-τ dds-oa, are
cassu from cae-co and noxa from nocco. The latter, which is

' synonymous with βλάβη, “hurt, let, hindrance, damage, punish· γ

ment,’' ia opposed to noxie, really an adjective agreeing with
ras, consillia, or caleo, and signifying “guilt” or '“crimel’
Hence the distinction between ira-aomos, i. e. re, and ramas,
i. e. anieno. Ob-uoet'ua seems to mean “declared guilty and·
brought up for punishment.” Idiomatically it is used in the
sense “under obligatior to, at the mercy of'’ (Sallust Catil. xx.
XLVIII. desperet. rixas). The nouus in which the terminatius
Fa assumes the form o, are much less numerous in Latin than in
Greek. We have, however, the following: alvus, ‹rr-vam, cal '
osa, cer-oua, οιὲοιὶι, cla-vrb, clu-eus, cor-vus, cur-oue, ‹sq-eus, fla-mrs,
ful-eus, fur-oua, paucus, lue-vus, aer-eus, praesumpsissem
vus, salvus, ser-vus, tor-vus, val-va. Is we compare caccus,
clavis, car-eus, poa-eas, levus, with the Greek κε’-ρο·ῐος,
shri- Fre, ιγῦρ- loe, γεννα-ῑος, haiae, we shall see that the ο iri the
former cases corresponds ιο a digamma in the terminatione of
the latter; ner-oue and par-vus compared with νεῦρον and παῦρος
