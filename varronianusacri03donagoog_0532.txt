Among these noune, we must take care to distinguish between
those in -οφε from capet, aa biceps, gen. hiem, and the
syntectical componnda inrolving -capa from capto, as municeps,
gen. municip-ia, dic.

Although thie olaasification of the componnda is sufficient for p

all practical purposes, ao far aa the Latin language alone ie con·

cemed¹, it is convenient, with a view to comparative philology, ἵ
ιο inquire how far these composite formatione admit of arrapge-
mentinaccordance with the system of the Sanecrrt grammanens. ¹

As I have compared the ern classes of the camden with the

Greek dompounds (Neu Orat §309), and as Bopp has subse Ῐ

quently adopted thia arrangement to his moro general purpoaea

(Verpl. (drumm. pp. 1427, foll. yl. Abiecit. 1852), it may bo as
well to place the Latin formatione under these heads. The six
classes of the Senserit eamden are designated by names, some of

which describe and others exemplify the nature of their con-
struetion3 and they are arranged by Vopodo‘oa ιιι the following

order: (1) The first are described by the term donadac, re. χ

“two and ιιιο,”ι ‘pair‚” or “doubling,” and conaist of merc

Ἰ aggregatione of words which might bo written separately and

joined hya copulative conjunctiones αφιιὶεὸηιᾶιι, “Agni and
Soma,” in the dual; brdhmariorloehatriya-ve'f-ptdraa the four
Indian cautes, in the plura13 &c.; (2) the second are exemplified
and named by the compound baba-orthi, ⁴⁴ that which has much
rice,” and therefore conciat of compound epitheta3 (3) the third
are called harma-dbdrayc, “that which comprehende (dhdrayatr)
the object (sarma)‚‘’ and include euch words as maliet-rm,
“a great king,‘' where a substantive is defined hyan nninflected
epithet prefixed3 (4) thc fourth, exemplificd by ιοιφιιτωῇα,
“ the man of him‚'' comprises componnda formed of two or more
nouus, the first eet being in some oblique case governed by the
laet, which may be a substantive, adjective, or participle' ιιι -ια,
as Νῆα-Ριινιιοιιαιι,ι ‘the king'emanff’ (5) the fifth, called daupu
from dvi‚⁴ ‘,’two' contains componnda of which the first part is a
numeral and the second a noun, as οΙιοιιιν-,ιμιοα-οι,ι ‘the four

ageso ofthe world;'' (6)the last elasa ra called august-bladon, or

inferior to tho Greek in tho power of formIng compound worda.
