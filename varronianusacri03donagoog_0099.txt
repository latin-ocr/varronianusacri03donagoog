elsewhere (cumaea Easoys, 1856, p. 35) suggested that the
Garadrr'aus or Hamdrsbas, i. e. the older branch of the Celtic
stoek, occupied in prehistoricsl times an area extending from the .

isles of Britain to the eost coast ol Italy, and were intruded
upon by the kindred raes of Leleges, Ligyes, Liguriam, Lige-
risns, or Lloegriaus, who established their line of occupatior from
this Hamber-land of Eugland across Franoe tc the Alps, the
Tyrol, and the seaboard of Genea, and who also found their

way ιο the southern regions of Italy and Grecce, probably by
tho western coast of the former peninsula The first inhabitants
ol Spain and Sicily are called Iberisns by every ancient writer,
and they are identified with the Sicanisus3 and Philistus must
hawe referred to these when he said that the Siciliane were Li-
gurisus who had been driven southwards by the Umbriaus end

Pelasgiaus (Dionys. Hal. 1. 22), meaning oi course the Low-
German aud Solavouiau tribes, who subsequently occupied north
Italy. With regard to Graece, there is uo reason why the
Leleyes, whom we have other grounds for considering as Celtic,
should not be regarded as exhibiting the name of the Lebyea
with that reduplicatiou of the initial h which is so universal in

Welsh¹.
