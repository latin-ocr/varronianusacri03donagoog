declension exhibite -ἅ, -ᾶ, -ᾶς, -η, -ης, Thus we have not only
cedd by the side of ἅμιλλά, but amr'cs'tr'ci, scrrbd, ared, aotd, ho-
micide, by the side of φιλίᾱ, rapide, συκέᾶ, τρίβη, ἆνδρειφόωης.
And even when Greek nouns are transplanted, the same shorten·
ing of the last syllable may take place3 thus πέτρᾶ, cesa and
πύκτης become petrei, suad and pyctd. The explanationes this
phenomenon is to be sought in the general tendency to abbrevia-
tion, which characterizes the Latin langnage‚ and which is perhaps
connected with their habit of throwing the secent forward In
many cases tha short dis not merely an extenuation of the syllable,
bnt an abridgment involving the omission of one or more forma·
tire letters. Thus, as φιλίᾶ must be considered as a contraction
of φιλί-ιι-σᾰ, the same omission must have taken place in amat
tia, and we shall see a further proof of this when we come to the
nonnsin 5s== -d-a's. A eomparison of κριτής, συκέα, -ἢ, and ταμάις,
shows as that these words involve the second pronominal clement
under the form ia = yc. And we must presumo an addition of the
same element in aceldemach-yos, beedmot-poso, amma-a
= demasii-yos, dre. The length of the ἃ in samilirts :familiae
jbmih'd = familiari, filicibus = filia-idua, filicis :fidelem-e, is of
course due to the absorption, in each ease, of some original letter,
soreoently belonging to the inflexion that it could nothe forgotlem
and with regard to the genitive in particular, we are able to sup
port this inference by an appeal to a considerable number of
forms in -aes, which are still found in inscriptions (Corssen, 1.
p. 103). That the nom. pl. corresponded inform to the gen.

As the nominative of this declension ends in -asor -er= -rua
and the accusative in -um, it is necessary to etate to the beginner
why the characteristic is said to be o and not a: but to any one
who has made even a commencement in philology, it is obvious
that while the forms in fd, -dram, -es could not have sprung from
an original u, the forms, in which ashort a appears, would natu-
rally result hom a short ὅ (above, ch. v11.§ 5). Besides, many
