In the year 1835212101120 figure of a man in ermour was
discovered near Tods‘ (utam), on the horders of Umbria. The
inscription, which was detected ou the girdle of the brocost-plote,
has boen interpreted from the Greek, Latin, and Hebrew lau·
gungoe by a‘number of different scholare. It appears to me to
contain four words, which may be added to the above list, aa

they cre all explicable from the roots of the Latin lauguage.
The inscription runs thus:

fflsuuuuumsl’vuvururn

The word titis occurs in the Eugubiue Tables (1. h, 45), ancl
punmn is obviously the accusative of panca, another form of
pune, panca, paci, which are known to be Umbriae words. It is
true that the Latin syuonynr pansis and the Eugubine words
belong to the 6-dcolcusiou3 but that is no reason why we should
not have a by-form of the o· dcolension‚ and that this form
actually existed in Messapia is well known (Athen. 111. p. 111 cr
πανὸς ἄρτος Μεσσάπιοι). These two words being removed
from the middle, the extremitias remain, ncmely, alalos and
pepe. With regard to the first it is to be observed that the
lengthening of a syllable, by doubling the vowel and inserting
the letter h, is common in Umbrian (sec Leps. de Tabe. Ecqcb.
