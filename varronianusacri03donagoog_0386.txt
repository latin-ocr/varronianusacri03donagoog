is always connected with pater under the form of Jupiter, eorre-
sponding more nearly to the Greek vocative. Thus Catullus
(uxrv. [uxv1.], 48) translates the line of Callimachus word for
word as follows:
Ζεῦ πάτερ, air Χαλῦβον πᾶν &aare rim.
Jupiter ut (ihalyhbn omne genus pereat

The analogy between the nouus in i and u will be seen from
the following comparison:
N. pepp-ie trid-us N. A. ret[a'=]e ωηι-ιι
G. puppas trab-tia G. ret-ab eom-ua
D. puppi tribu-i or tridui D. ret-i coru-u
A. pepp-im trab-um N. pl. ret-ia omre-uc
Abl. pepp-i trib-u G. pl. ret-ium eona-m
G. pl. pepp-iam trib-uum

There are two nouus ol the ι’ declension, which deserte es-
pecial consideration, not only ou their own account, but also ou
account of some remarkable asmnanoes in the cognate languages,
which might lead to misooneeption or confusion t-these are rea,
“a thing or object,’' and mare, “the sea.” I have shown, in
another work, that res =lz-ra-ais is a derivative from Ιιίνεχείρ
(Varro, L. L. 1v.26), and that it must therefore be compared
with the Greek χρέος, χρεία, χρῆμα, to which it bears the same
relation as heac, luridus, dcc. do to χλαῖνα, χλωρός, dre. Gon-
sequently, res is “that which is handled,’' and means an object
of thought in accordanoe with that practical tendency of the
Roman mind which made them regard all realities as neeessarily
palpable¹, whereas the Greeks were contented with the evidence

predicantes ἐναργήςζ ἐμφανής, σαφής, dic, referring to light,

¹ Ariosto (Orlaado Furioro, ru. 1) speaks of the vulgar belief as de·
pandent on the sight and touch combined:
Che ’l sciocco vulgo non gli vuolda fede,
Se non le aede e wora chiara o piane.

’ ²For this use of ἐναργής we may compare AEschyl. Pera 179: ἀλλ’
οὐδέπω roiord' ἐναργὲς εἰδόμην with Soph. Troel. ll: φοιτὸν ἕναργὴς ruri·
posu which is opposed to ἀνδρείῳ κύτει βούπρῳρος or the partial assumption
of the bovino form. Just in tho samo way we find iu Shakspere
(K. John, 1. 2):

Mine eye hath well examined his parts,
And finds them perfect Richard. ’
