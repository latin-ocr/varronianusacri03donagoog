are some noune in -r‘- which retain their characteristic throughout
the cases—as aitis, Taberr'a, febris, pupptb, &c.,-··it not unfre-
quently happens thet the shorter vowel e is substituted in the
nom, acc, and abl. sing, and this isalways the rule in the nom.
and acc. pl. So that, generally, the criterion of a noun in ι’ is
furnished only by the formos the gen. pl. Thus, although we
hare nubea, nubem, nube, audes, we have always nabe-um. The
peculiar noune in -es= -ae'a, in which this characteristic r'is ap·
pended to a crude form in -ἄ, sometimes appesring as a distinct
nonnos the first dsclension (cf. mater-ia, “ the mother-staff,’' or
‘¹ materials,’' ὕλη, with numismatum-rb), always retain this
θεαί, and consequently exhibit the full or proper form of the
gen. pl. in eum. For, according to the rnlc, s=r is not usually
elidad except between two short rowels, and the contractiori
διαί produces the same result aa the contractione ἀπα-ε and
δε ιδ’-ἔ in the first and second deciension, so that we have arum
= ‹rr-mm, orum = o-tram and erum = a-iram. As caath, juvenis

and vates form the gen. pl. in eam, we inser from this simple fact ⁸

that they are es improperly included in the -ί- declension as
other noune are excluded from it. If we compare cond with
κὺωνεκύον-ς, we shall see that theiis merely an unorganic in· ’
sertion after the liquid, and the same is the case with jaesum
whereas vates must be explained on the same principle as the
Greek compounds in -ης from neuter nonne in -ος, which exhibit
the lengthened form only in the nom. and accus. (New Orat.
§228). The neuter nouus in -c, which are shown by their abl.
sing. in -ἰ, their nom. accus. pl. iu -a‘a, and their gen. pl. in -r'um,
to belong to the class of -ί noune, are really the neuter forms of
adjectives in -ria Compare, for example, moent'c with omeuuaa'a,
mare and mille with coreb, cpite, rete with restris and irretire,
animal for anomale with oeqttclr'rr, dte. One of the strongest
proofs that the additional -c' is au indication of the adjectival in-
flexion is furniehed by the fact that while the immoveable vaus,
ueteres, forms its gen. pl. in erm, and while celer, denoting “a

horseman,” has no gen. pl. but aeleram, the regularly inflected
adjective celer, cebris, celere, hae agen. pl. celer-iam. The same
inference may be drawn from the relation between frcusa d aas, ·
&a (below Ch. xm. ξ 12). With regard to the nouus in land
rin particular, we must consider that the extensione in -lt's and
