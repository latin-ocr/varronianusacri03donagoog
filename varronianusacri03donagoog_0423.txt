rectly connected with the meaning of the sbletive, by referring
to the surfecc oi the object from which the separation tslres
ploce, whereas ec denotes s removal from or out ol the interior
oi the object or objects. Now de also presumes thet the thing

removed was spartos the object from which it is removed.
Thus while we heve no ‹rh-imo from emo, we here both mimo,

“to take ont,” end demo, “to tslre swey e part ’' (ss portem ‘' ¹

coltile demere de die), to say nothing os mono, “to tslre up,’²
prenso, ‘⁴ to take forth,” which imply approximetion to the seme
ides of pertition. This signification of pertition brings us back
very closely to the primitive meaning of διά, δίς, δύο; end we
hove absolute division in such phrases ss dedi de meo. From
the seme ides of pertition we msy get the sense of derivation
snd desceut implied in these end other compounds of de. And
here de comes into close contcct with the affines -θεν, tus, which.
undoubtedly belong to the seme original clement (see Nero Orat.
§263); thus dc cislo is exectly equivalent to celitus. While
διά corresponds to per in its sense of “ throngh‚'‘ sud to dc in its
³ messing of division iuto ports, we find thet de conversely coin-
cides with ereptio the sense oi “about” “ concoming,” ss de-
notiug the subject from which the celion or writing is derived,
sle. the source of sgency or the subject-matter (ὕλη). Thus
scripsit de republica means “he toolr the subject of his writing
from the general theme ot* the eommonweclth;'‘ for which e
Greek would heve said ἔγραψε περὶ τῆς πολιτείας, tie. “his
writing wns sbout or derived from the republic.” The con-
nexiones de sud διά is seen still more plainly in the form dt
or dic which the former bears in composition.

As de, though connected with διά, thus correspouds to one
of the uses of περί, while διά in its general mesuing coincides
with per, so we find that ob, which is etymologicslly identieel
w‘ith ἀμφί, e synonym of περί, agrees in one ot* its uses with
propter, end so with διά when used with the sccusstive. The

fact, thet ob msy be trsced to e common origin with ἐπί sud

ἀμφί, has been elsewhere estsblished (Nero Orat. ᾗῇ 172, 3), by
the following procis. There ceu be no doubt ss to the identity

of ἐπί with the Senserit api eud adli. Now abbi is related to '

ἀμφί, ss ablata is to ὄμβρος, oblau to ἄμφω, ambo, &c And
the snelogy oi ἀπό for ‹iv-ved, shows that ert must originally
