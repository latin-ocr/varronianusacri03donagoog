losses occasioned by this systematic abbreviation. Thus we
have regularly dici-w, or eien dubi, for dicereen- and less com·
monly mmpae for aumpaz‘ase, duc. In some mes this abbrevia·
tion will appear in a compound, though the full form is retained
in the simple word. Thus, we find equitus and coyntae by thc ‚
side of scottenwilre and dejero by the side of juro, and the same
differente oi quantity may be affected without any change in
the spelling, as in nubilum by the side of ditum. This influenoe
oi the accent is the more felt in proportion to the length of the
form; and sometimes we find two or three abbreviatione in the
same compound. For example, although the gen. cujm retains
the originaltermination, this has been shortened into ἶ. in the
compound: euicui-modi for cujus-otp‘ueacodi (Cic. adAtt. 111. 22).·

The Romans, however, were not satisfied with getting rapidly
through their simple words and regular compounds. The same
principle was applied to the parathetic formatione: thus mepta
cadus was condensed into muctue¹, mugit colo was written mab,
non uolo hemme nolo, and so forth3 and not only so, but wc
also find that in the case of quasi-compounds, made up of two
or more words, which are not amalgamated hythe loss of in-
flexione into one whole, some part of the termination of the
first word is regularly omitted, and thns the group is subjected
to the deminution of a single accunt. It may bc sufficient to
mention such words as audin=audtbne Eone, Ecuawr, It'pol
