for digging” (nto); tam-bran, “a thng for crossing” (bamb
vora-tram, “a thing for pnriiying‘’ (vero, “to make 8888, ie
parsu''); voro-erum, “a thing for causing shame” (αἰδοῖον). We
should erroneously aaeign to this class 881888, opsnatu-am, cest·

mm, stop-rma, dcc, which are nonns in -mn or -ram ,- but we '

occasionally find a genuine noun in -trum strengthened by -s,
which 18 merely functional, 88 18 the Greek forms sehet-omis
from coarto, dcc. Such are oapi-atrum, “a thing for cutching'’
(copio); 18818881, “8 thing sor purifying” (looo); mon-stram,
“a thing for pointing 81” (maana popu-dn). To this class 1

would refer phoa-trum, which some have attempted to derivo ,
from plaudo, 88 chius-trum comes from claudo. It seems better ²

to explain the word with reference to Virgil: “ turdo Eleusina

matris volventia phrmtra'’ (Gom-9. 1. 163), which allodes to the ι

slow and heawy waggon with its solid wheels, as it is still found
in Lombardy'. In this way we shall rerert to the Greek mab,
πόλε88-τρον; the analogy 18 supported by scampah 81-
teucro· ἅμαξα ἡμιονική (Hesych.); and the,meaning hya

passage, which, however, introduces some subordinate ideas 3 l
soph. Antip. 340: ἰλλομένων ἀράτω ἔτος εἰς ἕως, imespqe'm p

πολεύων. Whether tho reference to tha Eleusinian Ceres is or is
not to be taken 88 an intimation that the 8188818888 was 81
Greek origin, the're can be no reason why, 88 18 theatrum, soep-
8888, abtum, dra, 8 Greek name should not have been natura·
lized in this instance. In general, then, we may say that 88888
18 -tram indicate the thing with reference to the door, and so

denote the meane or opportunity 81 doing, whether considered aa
a place or 88 88 instrument.

The same is the signification 81 another set or rather double
881 81 words 18181, 1-1, c-r, 8-1 ,· thus we hare voluta-brutio, “a ι

place for rolling,” vena-hulam, “i thing for hunting,” sepel-
orum, “a place for burying,’' vehiculum, “a thing for carrying;’'
and bytho side 81 these we have nouns 81 agency in -1, as uolu-
cris, “the flyer,’' dcc. When we compare 11-188 with essenos
8818 with ἐρυ-θρός, 8-18 with οὖ-θαρ, dre, wo see that these
words, according to the principle 81 divergent articulations (above,

rumenam, which is probably for mhibra’eon (088888, n. td).
does not belong to this class.
