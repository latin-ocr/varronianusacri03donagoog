head of the Adriatic. And thus we traoe this distinctiva appel·
lation from scandinavia to the north of Italy, in aline nearly
corresponding to the parallel of longitude. The ethuographic
importanoe of the name Wr'aal can scarcely be overreted: for it'
not only tells us that the tribes to the east of the line upon
which it is found were generally pure Sclavonicn, bnt it tells us
as plainly that the tribes to the west, who imposed the name, were
equally pure branchos of the Gothic, Saron, cr Low-German
racc. Indeed, the latter fact is more certain than the former·
For if, as I believe, the term Wined merely indicates, in the
mouth of a Low-German, the end or mend-point cf his distinctius
territory, our infereuce must bc that whatever the Μηρώ were,
they indicated the boundary-line of some branch of the Gothic
racc. Now we have such a bounda'ry line in Bouaria ; therefore

the Roeticna who laced the Wndcla'cs' cr Lech-Wiacdc were ’

low-Germane. We have a similar line in the north of Italy3
therefore there must have been Low-Germane in opposition and
- contiguity at the western frontier of the Veneti or Wiacda on the
Po. But we have seen that the Etruscam, properly so called,
were Rotam, who et one time occupied a continuone area
stretching from western Germany across 'the Tyrcl into the plains

of Lomhardy. It follows therefore, aa an ethnographical fact, ’

theg the Etruscam must have been a Low-German, Gothic, or
on tribe.

These combinatione would be sufficient, if we had nothing
else, to establish prima facie the Gothic affinities of the old
Etruscam. But they arc only the first step in a cumulative
series of arguments, which, when complete, raises our conclu·
sion to the rank of a philological demonstration. Some of the
details must be reservcd for the chapter on the Etruscan lan-
grmge3 but the general effect of the reasoning shall bc given here.

If the ancient Etruscans were Low-Germane, they must
present the most striking marks of resemblance when they are
compared with the oldest and least alloyed branchos cf that
family. In the center of Europe the Low-German clement wes
ahsorbed hy the High-German, and the latter becameaqualifying
