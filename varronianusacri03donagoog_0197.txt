with ἔρις (ἔριδος), ἕρίζω, &c In these cases it must be supposed
to stand as a representative of the Greek ζ in its sound ab, and
also of the Hebrcw alsia, from which frhas derived its name
(sce Nero Orat. ξ 115). With regard to the nume Ulyaees,
myses, Ὀδυσσεύς, etymology would rather show that the
ultimate form of the e, aa, or a, was a sostened dental. The

Tuscan neme of this hero was Nonus, i. e. “the pygmy'' (Mtiller,
Etnwk. 11. p. 269); and, according to Euststhius (p. 289, 38),
Ὀλυσσεὺς or Ὀλισσεύς was the original form of the Greek
, neme. From these data it has been happily conjectured (by
Kenriclr, Herod. p. 281) that the name means ὄ-λιζος, ὅ-λισσος,
AEol for ὀ-λυγος (Eustath. 1160, 16), of which the simplest form
is λιτός, little: so that Ulysses, iu the primitive conception,
was a god represented in a diminutive form.

The materials, which are ct present available for un approxi-
mate philologicel interpretation of the Tuscan language, may be
diuided into three classes: (1) tho names of deities‚ dcc, whose
titles and attributes are familiar to us from the mythology of
Grecos and Romc; (2) the Tuscan words which have descended
to us with an interpretation3 und (3) the inscriptions, sepulchral
or otherwise, of which we possess accurate manscripts. Let us
consider these three in their order.

The Tuscans seem to heve worshipped three gods especially.
, ss rulers os the sky-Jonas, god of the sky in gencral; Jupiter,
whom they called Tine, god os the day3 and Summanus, god
cf the night Of these, Jancr and Tine cre virtually the same
designation. The root dyst seems to be appropriutcd in a great
many languagcs to signify ‘⁶ day” or “ daylight.” Soc Grimm,
Dent. Mytlol. td ed p. 177. Sometimes it stands absolutely,
as in dtr: dio-Q sometimes it involves c, as iu the Sanscr. dyo,
Gr. Zetis, Lat. deses ,· sometimes it appears in a secondsry form,
as in the Hebr. pom, Gr. ἡμέρῃ and sometimes it has a dental
affix, as in the Gr. Ζήν, Lat. or Tusa. Jonas. It is sufficiently
established that di, j, y, are different forms os the same articula—
tion, which is also expressed by the Greelrg. 'Phe fem. of
Janua was Delma: Jupiter and Diespiter were the same word.
