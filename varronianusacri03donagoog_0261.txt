ὅ 4. Fragmenta oftlre Solios Hymos.

The Salian songs, ifany considerable fragments ol them had
come down to our times, would have furnished ue with very ’
interesting specimeus of ancient Latinity. Unfortrmately they
are all lost, with the exception of a few lines and detached
words; and with them we have been deprived of the learned
commentaries of AElius Stilo, who was not, however, able to
explain them throughout. Varro, vn. §22 “AElii, hominis in
primo in litteris Latinis exercitati, interpretationem carminum
Saliorum videbis et exili littera expeditam et praeterita obscura
multa¹.” 01 the explanatione of AElius the following have been
preserved. Festus, s. v. Manuos, p. 146: “Maaaor in carmi-
nibus Saliaribus AElius Stilo [et Aureliae, v. Paul. p. 147] sig-
nificare ait borws: unde Inferi Di maaca pro doni dicantur a
suppliciter eos venerantibus propter metum mortis, ut immanes
quoque pro valde [non bonis] dicunmrss’, Id. s. v. Molucrum,
p. 141: “Molucrum non solum quo molae vertuntur dicitur, id
quod Grreci μυληκόρον appellant, sedetiam tumor ventris, qui
etiam virginibus incidere solet...(lloatius etiam [et AElo'as] in
libris sacromm molucrum esse aiunt lignum quoddam quad-
ratum ubi immolatur. Idem AElius in explanatione carminum

¹ Horace, too, assudes to tha difficulty of the Salian songs (11. Epist.
1. 86):

Jam saline N uma carmen qui laudat, ct illud,
Quod moecm tcaorat, solas vult eolre vider-i, dvo?
