The tradition speaks of the Pelasgian Latius as a colony of

Trojano vvho settled on the coast under AEneos, theson of
Anchises. Without entering at length into an examination of
this poetical legend, it may be mentioned here that the names
AEneva and Another refer, wherever they are found, to the
Pelasgian or Oabeirie worship of water in general, and of the
flowing stream in particular, and therefore indicate the presence
oi' a Pelasgian population. We have other reasons for inferring
the existence oi Pelasgians on the coast of Asia Minor, in Thes-

Hifer is so far from asserting the principle that tvo divergent articula-

maintains that “the guttural tenuis has a special relation to the sound u,
