Μαθιι is the Greek μέθυ, Sansor. mudhu. Marone ia the epithet
agreeing with matha: it contains the root mur·, found in Μάρων
(the grandson of Bacchus), and in Ἴσ-μαρος, the aite of his
vineyards (see od. lx. 196 sqq.), and probably signifying
“ruddy'’ (μαίρω, pcipe, dre). The fact that Maro was an agri-
cultural cognomen at Mantua ia an argument in favour of the
Etruscan use of the root. latiae· is the locutive of litat, an
old word corresponding to tu, “ ashes mingled with water.'’
Θῄυανεηαὲ is an adjective in concord with latmi, and probably
containing the same root as tepidus, taphral, tesormn, dre. (above,
pp. 56, 156). Ede is some particle of condition or timc¹. Erm'
is the locative of ἔρα, “ earth.” The idea of this second lineis
eonveyed by the sneer of Lucretius (111. 916 aq. Lachmann) ε

“Tanquam in morte mali eum primia boo sit eorum,
Quod sitia exurat miseros atque arida mnu*

it is probable that epona is synonymous with tor-ree, and that it
may be connected with δάπτω, dte, as opeda is with marem,
daps, brinnon, duc, or ἰφιίς with the root dat, “ to bum.’' uie

Eug. Tables). Thereoan be little doubt that neda means “ water''
in the Tuscan language. There is an Etruscan mirror in which
the figure of Neptune baa superscribed the word Nethuns :Ne-
etan-[up. The root is ne, and appears under a slightly different
development in the next word, nostae (comp. νασμός, ναθμός,
0. Η. G. aaa), which is probably a locutive in -φι, agreeing with
helops, and this may be referred to χεῖλος, AEolice χέλλος, Latin
heluo, dcc.
