pp. 251 sqq.). The primary meaning of mico is therefore best
preserved in the compound rii-raico, ‘·‘to light hand to haud.”
But mreo itself means “ to atrike or shoot out rapidly,'' as inite
application to the game called mmo, in which the fingens were
suddenly raised, and immediately afterwards compressed: and p

the same sense of rapid motion is implied in the secoudary sig· ³

nifications “to palpitate, twinkle, quiver,” dec. The primary
meaning is also retained in emico, ‘⁴ to atrike ont with a sword,
to make a blow or lunge,” as in Verg. AEneid xli. 728:

Emicat hic impune putans, et corporo toto

Alta sublatum Turnus consurgit in hastam

lit ierit.
And the same signification is conveyed when the verb is used
of ruuners shooting out at once at the commencement of a foot-
race (V erg. AEn. v. 318; Ovid. Metam. x· 652), or of a sudden
bound into the air (Verg. ὧι. 11. 1743 x11.327). Oi the
regular verbs of the first conjugation‚ the most troublesomc in its
etymology is pharo, which Dbderlein once (Lat. Hya. u. Et. 111.
155) considered as an intensive form of plico, and which he now
(etia. VI. p. 273) connects with pluo, fluo, and fleo. I cannot ,
accept either of these etymologies. As far as the signification is
ooncemed there is no reason to suppose that ploro ever meant
‘⁴ to shed tears,’‘ and such a meaning would he quite inconsistent
with the ordinary use of th'e compound replere. Festus tells us
(p. 230, Mulier, quoted above, p. 238), that the original meaning
of ploro was inclamo or invoco ; and with regard to ploro he
says (p. 79): “explorare antiquos pro wehmare usos, sed postea
prospicere et certum cognoscere coepit significare. Itaque spe-
culator ab enplorotom hoc distat, quod speculator hostilia silentio
perspicit, explorator pacata clamore cognoscit ;'’ and tho Gbrssor.
nath. explains erdeplorato by ἐπικάλεσον, which is more acon,

⁰ ' rate than the account given by Festus (s. v. p. vt). In a frag-

ment of Varro, quoted hy Forcellini, who is unable to veriiy it, ,
we have: “gemit, explorat, turbam omnem eoncitat,” from which
it appears that the original meaning of the word must have been
“ to cry aloud.’' Now we know that odoro, which does not sig·
nify, as is generally supposed, to put the hands to the mouth,
aud then stretclr them forth in honour of a superior being
(προσκυνέω), but rather “ to speak to'¹ and “ address,'’ is a com-
