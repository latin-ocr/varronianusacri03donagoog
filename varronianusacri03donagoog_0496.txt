HE term derivation wus once used tc denote the process ot' ³
guess-work by which the etymology of u word was uscer- ἵ
tuined, und it was formerly thought that the most satisfactory

derivatico of a Latin word was thet which consisted in its direct ¹

deductiori from some Greek word of similer sound¹. The student
ol scientific or comparative philology does not need to be told that,
although the Greek und Latin languuges heve u common clement,
or are traceuble‚ in port st least, to c common source, their mutual
relationship is collateral, und not in the direct line of desceut,
und that iu these und other old lunguuges of the Indo-Germanic

belonging to the pronominal or formative element of inflected
languuges, moy be prefixed or subjoined to c given form for the

expression of some secondury or dependent relation'’ (Nero Grai. ξ
Pref. lst Ed). According to this view, derivation includes a de· l
pertinent ct* what is called word-building (Wortbrldwng), sofar
as this is distinguished from mere inflexiou. The modificatione ¹

of the noun und verb, by which inflectcd lunguugc iu cheruc-
tcrized, belong indifferently to all forms, whether primary or
derived, whether simple or compound. And after considering Ἴ

worst attempts ot his predecessore.
