is confined to those neuter nonne which express a mere object,
as caps-t, corpas-s, and lac-ta (which occurs in Plautus, Marcet.
v. 9. 37); or to those nonna and participles which express
a thing done, or the passive result of arr action, as dapum,
“that which is pointed‚” compared with dayam, “that which
is shown,'’ liber-tua, “ he who is freed‚” compared with dri-eram,
“that which is given,” lac-trra, “that which is gathered” (ol
leaves and the like), compared with lay-nram, “that which is

bound ’² (ol a faggot), and the forms in -aua and -trm mentioned l
above 3 to which may be added scr-num compared with fatum,

and ray-raam,prry·rrc, perr-rra, poe-am mutand panis, compared
with rocam. art-ta, moer-ar, vri-ta, rapiam, &c An interero
ing class of words ending in -rac, which has been mentioned
already (above p. 467), deservo special notice. Il we merely
compare crini-tus or corno-tua with ama-tus, we might be dis
posed to adopt the common opinion that the former are derived

from the noune crini-s and corae, and the latter from the verb ,

root amo. And this view is taken by the latest writer on tha
subject (Aufreoht Troas. of tlte Platae. Soc. 1856 pp. 54 sqq).
But the meaning of crinitas andernensis thoroughly parti-

cipial; and the forms pratae-ttae and fortwttas show that they 2

aro derived from i-verbs with a causative meaning. Thus
oriere meant “to make long-haired‚'’ coma-b, “to make
homed,” fhrto-ro, “to make accidental” (for the form cf. for·
tana), dre. Verbs ol this class seem to have been formed

from' the verbale of simpler verbs ; thus from ductas and aar· ς
orm, the verbale of oa'ayo and verto, we have the secondary forms ᾗ
cincta-rb and oar-ea-r'o, presumed in cino-tatus and oar-satim l

and the adverb aetra-mm, “forthwith‚ on the sudden‚’' seems

to be the verbal of ‹rc-tao, which bears the same relation to ff
cro-tur that statuo does to statas. The identity of the affixas ,

-tam and -aean with amn and -lrrm may be seen by comparing

βελινςπβέλψτ, “a thing cast or thrown '² (jao-tam), with jaca· κ

lum, ᾱο-πιιπι with διδ-ρον, sco-ram with teuta and by com·
paring temps-c = tempu-t or tempu-lam (in cac-tempato, aoemrplo)
“a portion of time‚” (καιρός) with tara-plum and τέμε-νος,
whether as the templum of the angnr arrd the τέμενος αἰθέρος
(AEsch. Para. 357), or as the portion of land cat off and aet
spart for divine uses. Many of the nouns in -lam are used
