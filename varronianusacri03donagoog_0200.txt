10 other 101100, 00110 Greek especially, 1110100000 were used.
Accordingly, if we articulate between the liquide ln, 0010011011-
tute t 101 th, we shall hare, as the name 01 Juno, the goddess
of marriage, the form Tal[a]no, which at 0000 suggests the root
01 Talassus, the Roman Hymen, and the Greek 01λο0, (Soph.

The deity Vulcanus, who in the Etruscan mythology was
one 011110 chief gods, being 000 01 the nine thundering gods, and
who in other mythologice appears in the first rank of divinities,
always stands in 0 0001 relationship to Juno. In the Greek

theogony he appears 001101 000001 10100101ς he is sometimes

the 11001, 001 sometimes the duplicate, 01 his brother Mars; and
it is possible 11101 10 the Egyptian calendar he may have been 0
kind 01 Jupiter. Here we are only concemed with the form 01
his Etruscan name, which was Setlrlons. Apylying the same
principles 00 before, we collect 11101 itis only Se-tullo]nus, 0
masculine form 01 11110]οα (-· June) with the prefix Set comp.
the Greek 111100, celerior, with the Latin Sol, Luna, where the
feminine, like Tol[a]na, has lost the prefix.

Το the two deities Tira and Talna, whose names, with their
adjuncta, I have just examined, the Etrurscans added a third,
Miner-oo, or, as they called her, Minerfa, Memfc (sec Quintilian,
Ι. 0. 1. 4, 5 17), who was so closely connected with them 10 the
10001000001 this people‚ that they did not consider a city com·
plete 1111 had not three gates and three temples dedicated to
Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva She was the goddess 01 1110010111ιο
prevalent about the time 01 the vernal equinox3 001 her 10001,
the quinquatria, was held, 00 that word implied iu the ’100000
language, 00 the fifth day after the ides of March. The name
seems 10 have been synonymous with the Greek μῆτις; 001
bears the same relation 10 mem that lueroes (in the Arval hymn)
100010 laec: this appears 11010 the use o'f the verb prmneneroat
(promosset, Fert. p. 205).
