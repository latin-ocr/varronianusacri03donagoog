elements3 hum which we may infer that tho earlier parts ol the
word have successively lost their significance. Thus, the words
anob, bom, and wwn, are synonymous, though belonging to

different ages of our language; and yet we have compounds l

such as mele-hom and Ham[p]·tou-wrble. The words wan, 3

decla, and uota, are synonymous ; and yet we find a stream in l
thenorthol' England called Wuno-beclc-wuter. The words nupera ³

aud paro in Sanscrit both signify ‘⁴ city ; '’ but we find in India
· 'a city called Nep-poor. 'ln the same way, we believe that both Ἴ
parts of the word Iacer denote “water'' or “river'' The first p

part of the word is contained in the name of our own river =

'Romen or Tam-inb, the upper part of which is still called the
Ia-ir: the second part we shall discuss direotly‚ in speaking of

the third Scythias river. The other and more recent name, ἶ

Dan-abina, also contains two elements, each signifying “ water”
or “risen'’ The latter part is found in the Guelic up, and
in our Aeon, &o.; the former in most of the Scythien rivers,

· The next river is the Por-uta or Procli, which obviously
contains the same root as the Greek word πόρος and the Scy-
thian porris.

The third river is called by Herodotus the Trione, undis
now known es the Dasea-ter or Denuo-ter. 'Phe letter pert ot*
this name is the same es the letter part of [cuer. The first
part of the compound is the commenoement of the other name of
the lotor. In the transcription of Herodotus, either this word
is omitted, and the Danaa-ter is mentioned merely as the Ter,
or the last syllable of Τύρης represents the first syllable of the ’
datar,- so that the Danube was called the Ister, and the Dna‘os-
tcr the Per-rb. It is singular that the syllables Dua, Don-‚ or

’ Duo, and Ter- or Tan, are used in the Celtic and Pelasgian

languages respectively to signify “ height,” or “ hill,” or “ hill-
tower ;’' auditis to be supposed that this was the origin ol their
applicatiou to the river, which flows rapidly down from its birth·
