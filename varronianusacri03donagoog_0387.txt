the Roman brought every thing to the teet of the touch, and f
pronormced s thing “mamjfeaestf’ssl—mooi-frotores) when he could ξ’ ,, , Ι
resch out his hand and feel it. With the Greeks the idea of ,² ⁶
handling was connected with that of fecility, rather than with

that of evidence: thus εὐχερής, “ easy,'' is opposed to δυσχερής,
“difficule’‘ and as μάρη in old Greek was a synonym of χείρ

(and probably skin to monos), εὐμαρής is a common equivalent

to εὐχερής (Sohol. Ven. od Iliad. xv. 37). Now this word μάμη

brings us ,to the first of those apparent resemblances between the ·

Greek and Iatin, against which Ι would cantion the student.

For the Etymolop. Magn. directly connects pdp-rvr “a witness”

with μάρη “a hand,” and thus brings us back to the Roman
manifesta res,- the compilet says (p. 78, 11): μάρτυς ὁ μάρψας

καὶ εἰδώς τὸ ἀληθές. But, as I have shown elsewhere (Nera

Orat. 5 450), μάρτυς is not immediately connected nith μάρη,

bnt belongs to the same applicationes the root as cremor, μέμ·

ιμνά, dcc, so that it is expressive rather ol the memory and

spoken record than of the certainty ol the thing declared. And

here we have a remarkable difference between the Greek and, μ’
Roman conceptione of “ truth.” For while the Greek worm-“⁶'‘ es
refers to rhemory, and the Greek ηθής to the absence of for· fimf 4)...] 's
getfulness, the Latin testeis refers to testo a piece of earthen-
ware used as aproot', ticket, or symbolam (cf. wasco, which is for ,A ’,η Ι
mora, end not from the Greek τέσσαρες), end verua, like thes ” “
ΤειιῐῡηὶοΙ wer and the Lithuanian peras, which mean both veras

and bonas (Graff, Synacd. 1. 913), indicates the certainty, good-

nees, validity, end protection, on which we may rely with confi-

dence. It 'rowell known to Latin scholars that veras even in

the classical writers not unfrequently recnrs to its original mean-

ing, end denotes rather that which is good, right, and proper,

than that which is true as amatter of fact. Thus, in Livy, 11.

48: oeream csse liabeo eos quoram sanguine et nidore portum ait,

And Milton ssys (Pareo. Rep. 1. 82):

A perfect dove dsscend3 I m
he. druppis περιστερά. Aristotle (Eri. Meam-1. 1, 3) uses ἐναργής and
φανερός as synonymous expressions for that which sslls within the resch
ol our ordinary experiente.
