(Orelli, 1384), dre. The same root may also appear in the Perss
sian local names cited by Zenss (de Deotnclen, p. 286), namely
Ταβιήνη between Garamania and Parthia, Ταβιάνα 55 island
· on the coast 01 Peraia, Τάπη 5 city in Hyrcania, Τωπουροί or
Τααιούρειιι, people in Media and on the Imaus.

Ζεύς, or stc' πατήρ (Jupiter), was ,called Παπαῖος nr
“the Father,'’ a name by which he was known to the Latius
5150. Τ15 primary labial sounds are appropriated in 511155-
guages to express the primary relation of parent and child. The
children on whom Psammitichna tried his experiment (Herod.
· 11. 2) first uttered the articulate anund Βε-κός, apparently the
first labial followed bytho first guttural; and in some articu-
laticns, 55 well as in the order 01 onr alphabet‚ this is the natural
sequence. To this spontaneous utterancc 01 115 first labials to
designate the parental relation and the primary necessities of
infancy, 1 have referred elsewhere (N. Orat. 5 262); 556 11
seems to have struck Delitsch also (1505090, p. 131), when he
speaks of those nouns “ quae aboriginum instar sine verbi semine
sponte provenerunt, velut 15555, primi labiales balbutientis
pueri, Sanser. ρι’-151, matri, dra.” The word παπαῖος shows 55
very clearly the connexion between the Persian and Sarmatian
languages3 for while in the Pehlevi, as Richardson tells us, (s. v.
111) “the name bata or 151 15 given by way of excellence 10
express fire, which they worship as the father and principle 01 all
things, ” we find Boboa‘ in Jornandes (cc. 54, 55) as the name of
aSarmatian king. According oto Xenophon (Cyrop. VIII. 8,§24)
the Persiana distinguished between Jupiter and the Suu, and he
5150 speaks 01 separate sacrifices to Vento and Jupiter (Cyrop. 1.

6,,51 vll 5, 557). Β51 15 may very well have confused be·
tween the different ingredientem this worship 01 firc.

'Phe Scythian name for the goddess of the Earth is Ἀπία.
This word actually occurs 15 Greek, as the name 01 115 country
where the Pelasgians ruled· and 1151001515- or Op· 15 01 fre-
quent occurrence both ι5 Greeee and 111 Italy(Buttmann’ 5 Leorl.

Aa the Scythian religion appears to have exhibited an ele
mentary character, we should expect that their Apollo would be

“the god 01 115 aun.’ 'And thia seems 1ο 15 the meaning 01
