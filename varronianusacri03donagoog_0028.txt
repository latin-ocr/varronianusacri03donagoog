Lavinium, or from the opposite side of thc river near Caere3 and
the whole body became one city, governed by a king, or muqhter
populi, and a senate3 the latter being the representatives of the
three original elementa of the etate-the Latin or Oscan Ramnes,
the Sabine Titienses or Quirine, aud the Pelasgian Luceres. It
appears, moreover, that the Etruscans, on the other side of the
Tiber, eventually influenced the destinies of Rome in no slight
degree, and the last three kings mentioned in the legendary tra-
ditions were of Etruscan origin. In other words, Rome was,
during the period referred to by their reigns, subjected to a
powerful Etruscan dynasty, from the tyrauny of which it had, on
two occasions, the good fortune to escape. What Servius planned
was for the most part carried into effect by the consular consfi-
tution, which followed the expulsion of the last Tarquinius.

As these facts are established by satisfactory evidence, aud
as we have nothing else on which we can depend with certainty,
it follows that, in order to investigate the ethnical affinities of the
Roman people, and the origin and growth of their language, we
must in the first instance inquire who were the Latius, the Sa-
binas, the Pelasgians‚ and the Etruscans, and what were their
relations one with another. After this wc shall be able with
greater accuracy to examine their respective connexione with the
several elementa in the original population of Europe.

The general result will be this 2-that the Septimontium, or
seven Hills of Rome, contained amiuiature representation of the
ethnography of the whole Peninsula. Leaving out of the ques-
tion the Celtic substratum, which cannot be ascertained‚ but which
was probably most pure in the mountaineers of the Apennines,

· the original population of Italy from the Po to the straits of
Rhegium was, like that of ancient Graece, Pelasgo-Solanoniau.
This population remained unadulteratcd up to the dawn of ancient
history ‚in the central plains to the west-namely, in Etruria
aud Latium3 but in the rest of Italy it was superseded or ab·
sorbed or qualified in different degrces of fusion by a population
of Gothic or Low-German origin, which, although undoubtedly

, of later introduction in the Peninsula, was so mixed up with the

Celtic or primary tribes that it claimed to be aboriginal. When
this Low-German race remained tolerably pure, or at least only
infected with Celtic ingrediente, it bore the names of Umbrians
