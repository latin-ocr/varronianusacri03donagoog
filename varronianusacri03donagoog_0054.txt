of a great nation could have ancomplished the wonderful werke
which were achieved by this Tarquinian Lucumo. There is
sufficient reason to believe that Rome stood high asa Tuscae
town during the last years oi its monarchal history. The Sep·
timentium, ii not the capital of southern Erana, was at least
the southern hulwarlr of the twelre citios, and extended its domi·

regal power of Rome has been well ascribed to the decline oi
,Tarquinii and the rising predominanoe of Clusium. If. Lars
Porsena, when he conquered Rome, had really been anxious for
the restoration of Superbus, he might easily have replaced him
