medial form which comes nearer to the preceding liquid r (above,
p. 303); that in β, it is asaimilated to a; that in βΙ it is altoge-
ther dropt after rr ,- and that in ry it is soltened into a and r. In
comparing corpus, corpor-rh, with τεῖχος, reigo-es, we observe
that, although the latter has loct the σ, according to the rule,
because it is flanlred by two vowels‚ it could retain the neuter
characteristic before a consonant: thus we have ὀρὲσβιος from
ὄρος, careo-weilos from σάκος, &a Similarly, that the r ors
which takes the place of t in the Latin nouus, is retained in de-
rivatives‚ like gener-caus, from penca, penest, robus-tar from
robur, and temper-tua from tempus. i

Gen. Pl. -L-um, ·N-um‚ ·R·um.

(d) Liquid nouns are generally of dental origin, and many

of them recal to our recollection the neuter nouus, which have ἐ

just been mentioned. The only noun in m is the word irem-pc, J
gen. nemu, which is probably the corruption of a longer form 3
in mo: cf. χεῖμων and χεῖμα = xer'perr. There area few nouns
in l, as aol, solia adl, rotis (which is neuter, as well aa mascu-
line, and which, in that use, has lost afinal t), achil (sor citrium),
which is neuter and undeclined, and some compounds derived
from calio, as con-aul, prce-aul, erc-cul. The great majority of
liquid nouns hare crude forms in n or r=a ,of the former we
have semein -o, -iniu many in -do, -edo, -tdo, -uzdo, of which

’ the genitive is formed in ¹-diur'r, διας others in -90, rigo, 490,

-ttpo, which have their genitives in -pinir, &c.; others, again, in
fo, -io, -mo, -aio, -te‘o, which t'orm the genitive in -ὃπίε, dre. It
ia superfluous to give examples of all these different classes. In
comparing caro¹, gen. cornia, with sirpo, gen. cirpinir, we see
that two liquida in the former have coalesced to the exclusion of
the short ἶ,· and vrr90=cr⁸rptnr⁸s differs from commemor-a,
