inscriptions by an exaggeration of form3 thus we have DIS, sul,
ouIs, for Deis, olii, obiit: and thet, conversely, a doubled ·
vowel is written to represent one long vowel; thus we have
(Orelli, no. 1287) : LEEGEALBAANA for lepeAlbono. There

are some oases iu which along 1 represents the diphthong eir-oe,
suillis, prs'ea’enlts or primis, lebetas, polomot pepnb, fascini, &e
for aloes (Fest. p. 19), pericho (id. p. 205), hebertus (id. p. 121),
pelomnoe peplos (id. p. 205), fesoemnoe (id. p. 86) dre.

1,.-This is the commoneat power of the Roman 1. It is,
however, a representative ol Δ in other mssa besides those given
above: thus, inter stands for the old antor, ille represents the
Senserit onya, old Latin ollas, dre. From the examples quoted
by Schwertve, dns alte AEpypten, 1. pp. 543, sqq, there need
be no doubt that the older Romans used u as a representative
of 1..

1‚.-The sound of this letter is indicated by a pessage in
Velius Longus (p. 2235, Puteoh): “ Unde fit, ut ssepe aliud
scribamus, aliud enuntiemus, sieut supra (p. 2219) loeutus sum

de viro' et nram, ubi 1 scribitur et paene v enuntiatum unde .

Ti. Claudius novam quandam litteram exoogitavit, similem ei
notae, quam pro aspiratione Graeci ponunt, per quam scriberentur
eae voees, que neque seeundum exilitatem litterse 1, neque seeun-

rursus seeundum ‘latum litterae sonum enuntiarentur, utin eo

quod est lepere, sembere.'’ From this psssage we learn that 1 ·

before n was pronouneed somewhat like u, es in the ease with
us; end we also bow the importent inferenoe that lepore aud
sertem must have been pronouneed lire and serie. Iu anper
end the proper name Spurius this pronnnoietion seems to be ex·
pressed by the vowel u. The latter is e derivatiou from seper,
and is equivalent in meaning to &petto (above, p. 32) ; the ,
former is e derivative from ani-qam, as mey be proved by a
οιιτὶοιιε analogy between the derivatives ol ovi-s, “e bird,” and
‹e-s, “ e weight or burden.” For as edi-stenes means a person
who is eonversant with a temple (Fest. p. 13=aedo intimos),
so enitimur would mean “ eonversant with birds,” ees-timus,
