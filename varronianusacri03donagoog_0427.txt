Inter is not changed, except before l, when it becomes fatal.
Ob becomes oba before dentals, it is assimilated to lebials and
gutturals, aud is shortened into dbefore φης sometimes it

resumes its original m: thus we have atrab, shortened into
om, or aa before c, as in anceps.

Per is sometimes, hut not always, assimilated to a following l.

Pcat, or poce, becomes po, in pomerium, pmnera'dr'oaue.

Pro is written prod before a vowel, as in prod-est ,· it suffers
metathesis in pol-liceo, por-rigo, where it approach'es to the

ο cognate per, if it is not identical with it.
The inseparable re, really a form of io=dvcf, is written red before
a vowel, or the dentale d, t ,· compare red-eo, red-do, ret-tulf.
Sine appears only as ae or aed, the former with an occasioned
tmesis, as in Lucret 1. 453: aghaqi seque gregati.

Sat may change b to the following letter, and sometimes as·
sumes s before t, as in mdc-weho.

Trana may be shortened into tro.

Ve, or cehe, is not a proposition, but a particle containing the
same root as via =veta, cefro, weg, tw.

Negative particles fall into two main classes essentially dif-
ferentin signification3 for they denote either ἅθπίαἶ, which is
categorical negation, or prohrbt'ta'oa, which is hypothetical nego·
tion3 in the former case, we negative an affirmation, i. e. affirm
that the case is not so; in the latter, we negative a supposition,
i. e. prohibit or forbid an assumed or possible event. Aa these
differenocs are absolute in logio or syntax, it is necessary that
they should be expressed hythe forms of the words3 and the
three classical languages have sufficient, but by no means iden·
tical, methods of conveyiug these distinctions. The Greek lan·
guage expresses categorical negation by the particle ori‘or ori-a, ·
amounting tc &vc-foa, which denotes distance and separation,
but takes for the expression of a prohibition or negative hypo-
thesis the particle μή, which is connected with the first personal
pronoun, and is therefore opposed to odeas subject is to object
(Nero Orat. ξ 189). The Hebrew language has the same root
b, which is ultimately identical with the Indo-Germanic ac or
cresc, to express both negation and prohibition 3 but while the
