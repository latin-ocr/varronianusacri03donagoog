have 11100 and r'sta for {nnn and ritus, and just as we have necasse
by the side of 11011111. 01 all the words, in which this root
enters, ultro alone obscures the original meaning 01 “ distance
and separation.’' It seems to be used aa a synonym 01 sponte,
which significa “os one's own aecord'’ or “free inclination.‘·'
But an accurate examination 01 all the passages, in which it
occurs, enables us to trane it bach to its original meaning, “to a
place beyond,” which 'is still found in such phrases as altro
ritum a ma, “take him far from me” (Puer. Oapt. 111. 4, 19),
atrro citroque, “thither and hither,” tris &marra vitam umus,
et miserescimus altro, “ to these tears we grant his life, and
pity him besides'’ (see Dederlein, Syn. u. Etym. 111. 103, sqq.)-
Hence, while sponte, which is the abl. 01 a-yrona or copone, a g,- „.
derivative of another form ospoadus, means “ by its own weight
or inclination,” “ 01 its own accord,” ‘⁴ unbidden” (Hor. 1. Epist.
ΧΠ. 17: 0001111 aad, jassoenc), altro means “going still sarther,”
“going beyond expectation,” “showing an activity which ex-
cites surprise,” or the like. Thus we find anch phrases as
(Plautus, Mil. Gt. 11. l, 13) r citasse altro mansi mulieres secta-
rr'er, “ he says that cll the women even go sofar as to run after
him ;” (Tac. Ana. x111. 23): commatris qai 01101011, ultroque
spiritusque mitigantibus, “when those who stood by were affected, '
and, what is more, actively bcstirred themselves to pacify her
wrath ;” and (Hor. Ourna. IV. 4, 51) ε sectamur altro qrros opem
fallere ot effiryera est triumphus, “contrary to all expectation, we
pursue those, whom wc ought to be only too happy to escape.”
It is clear from this that no single English word is more nearly the
equivalent of ultro in this secondary application than our com-
mon particle “ even.'' The truc force 01 ultro is also seen in the
quasi-compound altro 1111010111, which is the correlative of coetr’yal,
and implies that as the sarmers of the maes (vectigalia) had to pay
money into the treasury, tha state had even to advanoe money to
those who contracted for the public works (σὰν-01111110). Thus we
read that the censors incurred odium when they diminrhhad the
payment on account 01 the latter, and increascd the sums to be
paid in on account 01 the taxes (Liv. mlx. 44) r vectigalia snm·
muprettu, altro tributor'nfimrh 1000001111, which Plutarch (c. Car.
p. 347), explains by: συστέλλων τοῖς μισθοῖς τὰς ἐργολαβίας, τὰ
δὲ τέλη ταῖς πράσεσιν ἐπὶ τὰς ἐσχάτας ἐλαύνων τιμάς. This
