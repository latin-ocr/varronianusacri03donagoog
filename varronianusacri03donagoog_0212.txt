erant facta inutilia” From the analogy offainbac, mamhra,
and from the circumstance that the Romms seem to have
learned to malsc succisa from the Etruseans, it is infened
that scotica was a Tuscan word: see Mtiller, ad Festi Ζοοιιιιι,
and Etrasle. 11. p. 239. The word is probably connected
with soom, bocca, dec. We shall see below that batn was
the Rasenie synonym.

Sabine: see Vama, L. L. v1. ξ 13. lf we compare fidaei,
dre, we shall perhaps connect the root with focco-ttamen,
whence fanilla, dcc, and understand the “torrido cum mica
farra,” which, according to Ovid (Fac. 11. 24), were called hy
this name.

Featbo, according to Lactantius (de Feb. Rebi). 1. c. 22,§ 9),

“ was the old Italian name of Fatue, the feminine form os

viris.'’ The form I‘lntlra'a seems to occur on an old Tuscan

perhaps a Tuscan word. The analogy of Feralia to Fatua
is the same as that which has been pointed ont above ln the
case of Mantua The a is a kind of aomwdroh very common

Ginai, “a crane.” Hesych.: Ὑ[ι]νι’ς· γέρανος, Τυρῤηνοί. This
