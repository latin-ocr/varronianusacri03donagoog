between the name of the Ambronar and that of the river Umbro ,-
and no Englishman is ignorant that the North-umbriano are so
called with reference nto an Y rubra-laod through which the river
Hunrder flowed. Dr. Iatham (Tac. German. Epilegom. p. cx) has
suggested a connexion between a number of different tribes which
bore names more or less resembling this, and he thinks that there
is some reference in this name ,to the settlement of the race
bearing it near the lower part of some river. Thus the Am-

broaea seem to have been on the Lowcr Rhine, the Umbri on the
Lowcr Po, the maenam of Cumberland on the Solway, and
the Gambrivir' and Srsspamtra' on the Lower erine. Dr. Latham

also conjectures that Humdcr may bc the Callia and cast British ¹
form of the Welsh Ater and the Gaelic Ιηυονπιι mouth of a ,
. river.” It appears to me that the Sigambra‘ and Gambva‘vii
belonged to a German, not to a Celtic stoch, and I am disposed ’

to refer the name of Centho-land to the form Cymmoy. Itis of l
course quite possible that the words Cymmry, Cambrebn, Cam- ¹

hoho, Cimbri, Cimmerii, Gomcr, &a bear the same relation to
Hamber, Umbro, Ambroaes, that arbi does to abi, kdmayttmi to

Camber might be different pronunciatione of the same name. But
Ido not think it reasonable to suppose that Humbcr or Umbro isa
dialectical variety of Aeo or Inoo. It can hardly be doubted
that the name of Umbrae points to a continuone population of
Ligarianam Ambroneo extending from the Cottian Alps to the
Tiber; and there is every reason to believe that this was only

part of a Celtic population which occupied originally tha three ,
· ’ peninsulas of Graece, Italy, and Spain, together· with the great

islanda of Britain, Irelaud‚ Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica. In
Italy the Ligariana and Umbrians stand side by side, and it is
only in the country occupied by the latter that we hare the
river, which gives a name to the people. But the Lech, in the
originally Celtic district of Ravana, contains the same root as the
name of the Iapyer or Leleges. In Franco we have the Idy-cr or
Loire, i.e. “the great river,” by the side 'of the Canum or
Coronae, which combines the Caelio Gar, found in carry,
Gany-owen, dec. with the other word embadon, amhae, Umbro.
And as the Lloeyrabus, or Britons of the south and east in this
island, are identified with the Gauls of northern Franco, it was
