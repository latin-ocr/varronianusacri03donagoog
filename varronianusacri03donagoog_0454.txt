(Alenus, Fr. 20, p. 675, Bergk.)
The strongest proof‚ that the involved meaning of the qma·
ἆίυιιυι is strictly that of the active verb, is furnishsd by the

well-known fact that the attracted form is regularly preferred to l

the gerund in -dt', uo, —dam governing the case, when the verb
of the genmd requires an accusative case3 thus we have: cd
aarum rather than ad tolerandum, laborm wnaaetudo homi
nam immolandorum rather than homines inmolanda} Maranirs'
reiyruhlicoe constituendo rather than wastitomdo rempublicam
indeed, thiais rarely departed from, except when two gerunda
of a different construction occur in the same sentence, as in
Sall oar. 4: “neque vero cyrum colendo aut amado, serri-
libus officiis, intentum atatem agere,'’-because emendo has
nothing to do with aprum The student might be led to suppose
at first sight that the phrase: he de ponentes repetundis, “a law
about extortion,” literally denoted “ a law concerning money to
be refunded,’' and that therefore the gerundivum was passive in
signification. But this gerundivum is used only in the genitive
and ablativa plural, to agree with pemnicram and maid, and
we happen to have a passage of Tacitus (Aorsoi. xm. 33) which

. proves that the verbal is transitive: for the words: o pao Lyci< 3

repetebant are immediately followed by: ἶφι repetundarum daor-
nutas est,· and thua we see that len de pecuniis repetunda does
not mean “ alaw eonoeming money to be refunded,'’ but, “ a law
which provides for the redemending of money illegally ameted.”

This view of the case appears to me to remove most of the

difficulties and confusions by which the subject of the genmd κ

has hitherto been encumbered. There are three supplementary
consideratione which deservo to be adduced The first is, that

in the particular case where the perendinam appears to be most ³
emphatically passive—namely‚ when it implies that a thing is

given out or commissioned to be dorae-it is found by the side of
the active infinitivo: thus, while we have such phrases as: “ An-
tigonus Eumenem mortuum propinquis repelaerdom tradidit”
(Corn. Nep. Eam. 13), we have by their side such as: “tristi-

tiam et metus medam protervis in mare Oreticum portora ventis'¹
(Hor. 1. Oorm. 26,1). That the gerund in this case is really
