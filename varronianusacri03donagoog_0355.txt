With regard to the nominative and accusative plural, the

· assumed original forms are derived from a round induction ac·

cording to the principles of comparative philology.

And first with regard to the nominative plural. Tha sign of
this case must have been originally -s throughout the declan-
sions. Now it appears from general consideratione, aa well aa
from an induction of facts, that -s was also the sign of the
nominative singular (Now (hulpiae, ᾗ 243). Therefore the -s of
the nominative plural, if it was to distinguish the form from the
same case in the singular, cannot hare been appended to the
mere crude form of the noun ; for then the nominatives singular
and plural would have been one and the same inflexion. It '
must have been fonned by adding the ·a (with, of course, an

intervening short vowel, for the Latin language does not tolerate .

adouble -s at the end of aword) to the full form of the nomi·
native, and thus constituting, as the total addition to the crude
form, or the real termination, the syllable -aea If we compare
lapid-es, patr-ss, with ἐλπίδ-ες, πατέρες, we shall see that the
long ein the Latin words cannot be accounted for otherwise
than by the absorption of sn a, which has probably become
vocalized in ι’. In the Greek forms this a, like the v of the
accusative, has been dropt altogether. This view is supported,
not only hy the fact that the plurale woh, adnot-n &a actually
stand in this relation to the singulare ti-ba', hdyp=hbyo=a dac,
but even more so by the analogy of the genitive singular. For
in many cases the genitive singular is identical, in its aecondary
form, with the nominative plural: thus famelica, aot', are the
common forms of both cases. But scmilsia is actually written
familida =fhmelicfe in oompounds with poter, mater, filias, dc.
Hence we may presume the same original form of the nomina·
tive plural familis (eddius, dte). Now the original form of the
ηοω. singular must have been famulab-³5 mnsdpuently, if, when
the nom. sing. was fumidis, the nom. plur. was familia-de =fc·
milvis (as in pertas, Fest. p. 371), it follows that when the nom.
sing. was fauisse, the nom. plur. must have been serafhia-ata.
The same follows from the form cci. The omission of a between
two vowels is fully supported by Greek analogiest for if ἶλέγου
ἱο manifestlya corruption of ἔλέγεσο, ἴχθυες may well be a simi·
lar corruption of ἴχθυσω. Ι have preferred to treet the original
