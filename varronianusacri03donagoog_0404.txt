(cf. Nero Orat. §§148, 243, 300). The common origin ol all
these forms and ot the Greek definite article is, as might he
expected, the second pronominsl clement, which indicates rela-
tive proximity. The Aulaot or initial articulation of this pro-
noun is the sound which we call ds'pommo, and which represents
some combination of the guttural with the labial. In the Greek
forms ὅς, κοῦ, κέν, dcc„ in the Latin Iti-c, rei-c, r's, dcc, and in the
Senserit poa, toa, dcc, we have only a guttural residuum, and
the y = τι is still further degenerated in rac, re, dcc. Iu ποῦ, and
theold Italianpit‚ pe, dcc, the labial alone remeius. But in tbe

Latin relative and indefinite qni and quis, and in the correspond-
ing particles, we have the genuine and original combination of
both clementa, the labial however being vocalized into a, or
rather represented by a silent c (above, p. 295).

It is usual to distinguish quir from qui merely by the use of
the former as interrogative and of the latter as relative, and no
one has been found to recognize the inherent distinction of the
two words. The fact is that quea, quoe (or rather qud), quau, is
the original form, corresponding to ia, ed, ἰώ· and as elle has a
secondary form ollas or oh'us, which is used as its adjective, so
poi, quo, qnod represent an adjective, and thismust heve con·

taincd the additional vowel o=u‚ which appears in so many of its r

cases. It has long been observed that in all interrogative and
indefinite pronouns the serm quod is used as an adjective and the
form quid as a substantive3 thus, we say: aliquod mmmmm,
- “some monster ;” but aliquid meretri, “something of a monster.”
The same remark really applies to the differences between the
simple qui and quoin and the two words may be arranged, cs
far as the forms exist, in different declensions, the adjective
belonging to the vowel declensions, and the substantive to the

consonantal formatione of noune. It is true that with regard to 2
the oblique cases, subsequent usage and habitual corruption hove ,
introduced many interchanges and conhreions ol form, but the ,

forther we go back, and the more careiully we examine the
derived and collateral words, the more reason do we find for the

conclusion that quis is substantival arrd consonautal, aud qui
adjectival and belonging to the vowel declensions,
