present, aa wellas active, appears from its opposition to theuso
ol the past participle3 thus: hoo sedandam curabo means “I
will provide lor the doing of this:’' loc factm volo meana “I
wish it were already done.” The second point to be noticed is
that deponent verbs, which have no passive voice, employ the
pertraditum in the attributive ose, which, we are told, cannot
easily he wrested to an active signification; as: proelio conjo-
ydm hqaendo, “battles for wives to speak of.'’ That these
attributive usages really correspond to active infinitives even in
those cases, in which the gerundivo might bo referred to a
passive verb, aa in: vir minime contemnendae, dra, appears
fmm Greek phrases like: ori πάνυ μοίρας diapante-at πρώτης
(soph. OEd. ool. 142). And ree timendae might be rendered “a
king to iear,” just as Wavorley declared (ch. xm.) that tha
Young Pretender was “a Prince to live and die under.” The
third case is thiu that the supines, which are only different
cases of one and the same verbal, appear aa active infinitives
ι when the accusativo is used (·tam), and as passive when the
ablativo is employed (tu). Now, this seemingly passive use oi
the supine in -tu arises from the lact, that it appears only by tha ·
side of adjectives, in which case the active and passive forms ol
the infinitive are often used indifferently, and some adjectivae
mire the supine in -tu when they expressly require an active

infinitiva, as in: “difficile est dean (= docere), quanto opere con· .

ciliet homines comitas affabilitasque sermonis'' (Cic. Off. 11. 14).
Now this supine, which is thus identioal with the infinitiva
active frequently alternates with the geruud; compare, sor in-
stance: qaid ert tam jucundam audita (Cic. de Or. 1. 8), with:

vado ad amandum jucunda (id. ibid. 1. 49). Tho activo sense ·

of the verbal in -taa=·eua is equally apparent in the dative case:
thus we find such phrases os (Sallust, «Inperti. 24); “quoniam
eo natus sum ut J ugurtha scelerum oswaldi essem,'’ i. e. “ since
Ihave been born to serve as an exhibition of (= to exhibit) the
wichedness of J ugurtha.'’

But the form in arduo is not only active in voice, but also, as
has been mentioned, present iu tense. Thus, if we take a depo-
nent verb, we osten find a form in »raim acting as a collateral
to the common form iu ·o[t]o, and opposed with it to the form
in -taa For instance, vocandae and seqarea[t]o both signify
