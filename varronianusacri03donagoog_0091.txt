the name ot* &naal to the two sister-taces, the Semitic ond
the Indo-Germanic, which formed themselves in Mesopotamia ’
and Irtn, and betam the twin-mothers of human civilisation,
and the joint source and home of intellectual culture. Το this
central gronp, I oppose the Eporedia ss including all those
natione aad languages which were scattered over the globe by
the first and farthest wanderers from the birth-place of our
moe. The process of sumessive peopling may be thas described.
While the Indo-Germanic or J aphetie race was developing itself
within the limita of Irbn, and while the Semitic family was
spreading from Mesopotamia to Arabis and Egypt, a great popu·
lation of Tchndes‚ or Mongolians, Celts and Turaniana, had ex-
tended its migratione from the Arctic to the lndian Ocean, and
from Greenland over the whole north of Amerios, Asia, and .
Europe, even as iar as Britain, Franco, and Spain. In propor-
tion, however, as these celto-Turanians were widely spread, so
in proportion were they thinly scattered3 their habits were
nomadio, and they never formed themselves into large or power·
ful communities. Consequently, when the Iranians broke forth
from their narrow limits, in compacter bodies, and with superior
physical and intellectunl organisation‚ they easily mastered or
drove before them these rude barbaricas ot’ the old world; and
in the great breadth of territory which they occupied, the Tu·
ranians have formed only four great and independent states-
the Mantchus in China, the anks in Europe, and the Aatees
and tho Pemvians in Ammon '
The student ofethnography must bear in mind some essential
differences between the spread of those Sporadic tribes, which
derived their origin from Irdn, and to which the aboriginnl po·
palation of Europe, Asia, and America is due, and those which
emigrated from Mesopotamia and Arabia, and furnished a sub-
stratum of dispersed inhabitants for Africa. For while the
Sporadic Syro-Arabiam in Africa exhibit‚ ss we go further from
the center of their dispersion, a successive degeneration in the
passage of the Aramaic langnages from the Abyssinian to the
Galla and Berber, from this again to the (latire, from the Caffre
to the Hottentot, and from the Hottentot to the oluclring of the
savage Bushman, and while there is no later inlusion of civiliaed
semitis elementa until the conquest of North Africa by the Arabs;
