am not awara that we have any example of the commutatico
of rt with the labio-dental r. With v it is not uneommonz
comp. Mulciber, Vuleaaue; pro-mulgere, pro-culpare (compare
di-valqare); &a This is still more remarkable is we extend
the comparison to cognate languages: thus Mare, mus (march),
may be compared with Ἑάρης, Ἑάῤῥην, hair, vinus, “ affl? „1

Vanus, Wiuaasy‘afle, &a (Attandl. Berl. Alc. 1826, p. 58).
So also μά-ν-τις may be compared with actea· at least, Plautus
writes maatt'sciaari for vaticinari. The changes of Ρ into Μ
are generally* observable in assimilatione such as mmmm sor

’ sapimus, supremus: in Greek, and in the passage between Greeki
ancl Latin, this change is common enough ; thus we have μετά
by the side of πέδα, and μόλυβδος by the side of plumbum. In ¹¹,
fact, ut ancl u are more neaissr akin to the medialsfla'and 1> than
to the tenues, and a thick articulation will always give the
medials for the liquida.

ι ht the end of Latin worden is very osten omitted in writing,
and seems to have been still morefrequently neglected in pro-
nunciation. With regard to the written omissione, it was the
mle to omit in the present tense of active verbs the important tt l
which characterizes the first person in many of the other tenses.

In lact, the only verbs which retain it in the present tense are
sama and laquo-on: and it is mentioned aa a custom of Cato the
Censor, that he used also to elide the tt at the termination of the

futures of verbs in -o and -io (aee ch.v1.§3). The metrical
ecthlipsis, which disregards the final -M when a vowel follows,
may be'explained by supposing a sort of enaverat in the Latin
language. In the transition to the Romance languages, which
makea new nominative ol the Latin accusative, the final m is
dropt in all hut two instances-the Italian spemc= pem, which
extends it by afinal vowel, and the Freuch cacavam, which
substitutes the nasal auolant.

The Roman gutturals are three-the medial o, the aspirato
