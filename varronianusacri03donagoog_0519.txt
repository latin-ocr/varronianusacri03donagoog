of an original tvo-ra (Now Orat. 5157). Be this as it may,

there can be no doubt thet the combination n÷t, which plays ,

so importante part in Latin derivatives, is a redupliceted form
of the third pronominal alemant, expressing objectivity in its
vagnest signification. Hence vve find this combination (resolved
into 21¹) aa the neuter plural of all nouns3 and either unresolved,
or in various forms of assimilation, 'in the third person plural
of verbs, in the active participles, end as a further effix to noune
corresponding in meaning and often in origin to the perfect
passive participle of the Greek verb and to obsoleta Latin
participles. In all these usages it denotes collective or vagus
objectivity-in the neuter plural, sheep or mass of objecta (like
the Hebrevv nge, Maean le-Sqrher,p.14); in the third person
plural, an action performed by en indefinite number regarded as
an aggregate3 in the participles, a mere notion of doing or b‘cing
done. In the present instance we are coneemod only with the
perticipial forms and the nouns connected with them·; and here
we find in Latin not only forms in -nt, aa amcn[t]e, or in m÷n
or me· nt, as oar-men, ver-teramnae, oar-men[t]e, hut also elonge-
tions of both in neu-⁸, -adu-s, and wentae. Thus ve have
quo-nm hythe side ol πᾶ[ντ]-ς, amaeuiue hythe side of
ama-rame, and the names ol places, which, in Greek end in
-ενω = -εις, our-c = -ους, or eure = or, generally appear in
Latin under the form -entum; thus Aeraque, Orumoer'e, Manen,
lym, Tarae, beoome Agrigentum, Gramentum, Mammam,
· Brraeenturn, Tarentum. Similerly, vve have arescentem, orno-
mentam, dre, hythe eide of cra-pap] -τσώμεντ, dre. These
extensione have occasioned some difficulties in Latin etymology;
it will be sufficient here to take the two interesting examples
supplied by fimdue and pedae The former is obviously, on
the principle just mentioued, sn extension of fimffle or fon[t]e,
the participle of fao, “to pour out,‘’ which is involved in the
agglutinate form fian-do (cf. per-do, cre-do, δια), and in the
frequentative fir-to. The nouus fon[t]s, “a fountain,” ie “that
