expresses, as Forcellini says, rationem efficii, convenire, oportere,
obstrictum esse ad aliquid faciendum. In both, the ideas of
interest and duty ere mixed np, and in general, when we say
thet r’t ir pood for cs ιο do any thing, we combine in one notion
the thought ol a moral fitness or propriety and that of an
advantage to be gained. We feel that we owe it to ourselves‚
when we feel that we owe it to our principles or ιο our fellow·
men. Hence, being in debt, which is the reverse of a good
thing, is expressed by an application of the verb, which conveys
the idea of justice or moral obligahnn, just as officinm, “ dnty,’'
belongs ιο the same family with officit, or obest, “it herms.”
In English we have only one word for what we “owe'’ aad
what we “ought ιο do;” and the German collon, “tc be in
duty bound'' (connected with our “shall‚'’ and “should''), be·
longe tc the same root as tetulo, “a debt.” The Greek phrase
deitatis εἰμι τοῦτο ποιεῖν, “I sm in justice bound to do this” =
“I ought ιο do it,” shows how the two idess nm into one another.
But the most decisivo illustraticn of the etymology of deb-eo is f ·
nished bytho affinity between the Greek ὀ-φέλλιο, “ ιο increase,'’
“ cnlarge‚” “benedt” “aggrandize,” ὅ-φελος, “ advantage,”
“ help‚’' “profit'’ ὠ-φελέω, “ ιο be of service” (ell from the root
phet, “ ιο swell,” end cll showing the ordinary meaning oi
250 end dot), snd their derivativas ὀφλι-σκ-ά-νω, “ιο incur sn

obligation,'' and ὀ-φεῦιωεοφέλψω, “ ιο owe,‘’ the impersonal'
use of which ὀφείλει, “it is fitting,” reverte ιο the meaning
of the other clsss cf words and of the Latin oportet end opus est.
As then d-teitfflo'pth-ym, with thc same pronominal adjunct
pa, forms the expression of duty from that of advantage, so
dod-w by the same machinery pasees to the sarire extension of
the primitive dat, “a fitting time‚’' dobeo, “ gdcd, nseful,‘’ dcc.¹
