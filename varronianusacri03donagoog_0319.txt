The difficulty which has been felt in dealing with the Latin '
chae proceeded chiefly from the supposition that the accompany-
ing a or v must be either a distinct vowel or a distinct consonant;
for if it ie a vowel, then either it ought to form a diphthong
with the accompanying vowel, or a distinct syllable with the ος
and neither of these cases ever happens: it, on the other hand,
it is a consonant, the vowel preceding the Q ought to be long by
position; and this is never the cese even iu the most ancient

writers (see Graff, Aba Berl. Aa 1839: ‘⁴ uber den Buchstaben
Q (a) '’)·

It appears to me unneceesary to assume that the accompany·
ing u ie either a distinct vowel or a distinct consonant. And
hersin consiste the peculiarity of the Rosam Q: it cannot be
articulated without the a, and yet the u has no distinct existence.
The true explanation, I conceive, is the following. No attentive
student of the Latin authors can have failed to observe how
great e tendency there is in this language to introduce sounds
consisting of an union of the gutbnal and labial. Such a sound
is the digamma, which may be considered to have been the lead-
ing characteristic ο1 the Pelasgian language both in Italy and in
Greece. Now there are four states of this sound, besides its
original condition, in which both guttural and labial have their
full power: the first is when the labial predominates‚ and thieis
expressed by the letter e= so (lo); the second is when the gut-
tural predominates‚ and this ie expressed by 023 the third is
when the guttural alone ie sounded, and in this state it mures
the strong guttural Η or 1(; the fourth is when the labial alone
is articulated, and from this we have the letter v.

The great difference between rande consiste in this, that
in the latter it is necessary to express both the ingrediente of the
double sound, whereas they are both represented by one charac-
ter in the former. Hence it has happened, that, while the gut·
tural clement ose bas been overlooked by many philologers‚
they have over-estimated the independent velue ο1 the labial
which aecompaniee Q.

A sound bearing the same relation to the medials that Q, does
to the munes is occasionally formed by the addition of o to (t.
This occurs only after n and r: thus we find tinyuo, utrque, ar·
praeaby the side of tingo, enyo, arpeo. The former were probably
