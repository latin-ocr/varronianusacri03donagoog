Attempts have been made to darive melior from 10000, because
we may have m by the side of ό (above, p. 290), and because a
· appears hythe side of l in βεΆμτιστος and βὲυ-τιστος. The
double change, however, from h to m and from c to liu the same
syllable, can hardly be assumed in a case where there is no evi-
· dence that the root ever exhibited either in its first or last letter
the modification which is supposed. On the other hand, there
are Greek analogias, which quite support the reference 01 notior
to molae. For there can be no doubt that there is a 1001000-
nexion between the ideas of excesu and depravity, of magnitude
and difficulty, as exhibited in the adverbs μάλα, μόλις, which
gire us the root of mol-ca and in μόγις, which gives us the
root of μέγας and μόχθος (Ν. Orat. §5 167, 185). There is

no reashn therefore why malda should not convey the mcondary

idea of difficulty and depravity, which is borne by μόλ-ις, while ·

the primary notion of superior magnitude aud higher degree,
which isborne by μάλα, μᾶλλον, and μάλιστα, is retained by
the comparative oct-ior. We have 0 remarkable trace of the
original form of malas iu the occasional use of male, as 0 syno-
nym for the Greek μάλα, or the Latin calda· thus we lind in
Horace (1 Germ. xvn. 21) male deperi for nimiam, vahla, ad-
modum dirpcrc‘,· (1 Eput. 111. 31) mole tram calceas for nimian
10000,ο 10 Catullus (x. 33) insulso male et molesto eicis for ad-
modum 100010ος 10 Tibullus (4 Germ. x. 2) 0000010 inepto cadam
for 01000 inepto (see Hand, Tarrell. 111. p. 584); in all 01 which
passages we sec the transition from the idea of excess to that of
disapprobation. All regular adjectivae form their comparative in
this way-namely, bysubstituting -abr for the flexion-form 01 the
' positive, aa dur-ua, dar-am, facil-ir, facil-ior, or, 11 the adjective
involves 0 verbal root, by adding ·r'or to the crude form of the
participle3 thus, the comparative of maledicas is not maledictor,
butmaledi-ceatior. There is no doubt that aliua and med-ica are
comparative words. The regular comparative in ·r'or, gen. -ieria,
is formed from the genitive of these forms, as appears from the
Samcrit tydae, Gr. -co‘rv=tov·r (Nero Orat. ξ 165). As the or·
dinal admits of two forms in -tca and in -rnca, and as the super-
lative is of the nature of au ordinal, we should expect that it
would be indicated by one or both of these terminatione. And
this is the case. We have -moa alone. iu pnssmca, extamus,
