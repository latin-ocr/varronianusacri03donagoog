If we hare recourse to ancient authorities, we find only two
definite statemente respecting the origin oi the Etruscens. The
one is the old story,—which first appears in Herodotus¹, whiohis
reproduoed in endless variety by later writers¹, and which the
young student learns from the addressee of Horace to his patron
Maecenas⁸,-that the Etruscane were a colony directly imported
from Lydia. This story was distinctly rejected by Dionysius,-
who not only proves by the authority of Xanthus that the etate-
ment of Herodotus restsd on no Lydian authority, but also
appeale to the total differenoe of the two natione in religion, lan·
gnsge, manners, and lews⁴. But although this story is entirely
,destitute oi historical foundation, and ie contradicted hy the lacte
of the case, there must be some way oi explaining its origin and
‚general acceptence. It has been suggested⁶ that possibly sn
isolated hond of pirates from Asia Minor may have landed in
Etruria, and that from thie the whole story hed its origin. Or,
that, more probably, it is nothing but a mere pun derived from
the occidental similarity of name between the Τυρσηνοί and the
Lydinn Τοῤῥηβοί. “By connecting,” says the author of these
conjecturem, “ the maritime commarca ol the Etruscam with the
piratical expeditioris of the Lydians, and by confounding‚ cs
Thucydides was the first to do,[the Torrhebian pirates with the
fillibnstcring Pelasgiane, who roamed over every sea, plundering
wherever they came, there has arieen one of the most deplorable
consensione of historical tradition.” Without falling back on
either of these suppositione, it seems that we have a sufficient
explanation oi this tradition—which stands on prccisely the same
