Umbriau also has shown us both the original formation aud the
corruption 01 'the accusative plural: 101 while 1101101οώ000
exaotly correspondiug to the (1011110001ᾐο-0,110 have also udrof,
which, as I have shown (above, p. 110), must have proceeded from
01101011 = ahma-a If we add to 11110, that when the accusa-
1110 singular has lost·its final consonant, the plural accusative ,
merely adds -o to the existing form 01 the singular (as in

· ἄνδρο[ν], rrlwrovrc[v], sing, diripi-e, rdmovvdw, plural), 110

have, it should seem, the 111001 satisfactory evidence which the
subject admits, in support 01 the assumed original form 01 the
accusative plural.

Having thus justified the only hypothetical forms in the
above scheme of cases, it will be desirable 10 1110110 001110 remarks

In the general scheme, the genitive singular 10 characteriaed
by the terminatione ·is, -0111, 01 jeta· the geu. plural by the
ending 1001, where the r is generally dropt, except in the a, e,
and o declensions, which constautly retain it. The difficulty

here felt is, to connect the plural form with the singular. ·

Struve's essertion (aba dic Lot. Decl. 3, 15) that the r is
merely euphonic, would tend, 11 we asserted to it, 10 complicata
and increase this difficulty in no small degree. The comparative
philologer cannot doubt that the original form 011110 genitive
plural in the Indo-Germanic languages was that which 10 pre·
served iu the Senserit -odm=aotr (000 Mtiller ad Vct-ron. L. L.
v111. ξ 74, p. 192). This 101111, 01101 the fourth century a. 11. 0.,
would appear fn Latin 00 sorr, which was afterwards softened into
111111. The Indians wrote -adm for -adm in many of their words
where the a represents the s, as in veken 101 metuerimus-a
but in the prououus, which generally preserve the authentieforms
longer thau the ncuns, we have tet-somatum. The Greeks
very often omitted an σ- between two vowels in a ease like this;
and as they wrote ἐλέγου ’101 thersae, 1χθυ-εο1011χθυσ-00, so
they gave us δήμοιο, 01 ultimately δήμου, 101 the original δημόσιο,
and pecodum, or ultimately μουσῶν, 101 ,1100οά01013 pauca-otone.
That -cam or -sc'cm was the proper and genuine form 01 tha Latin
genitive appears from the genitives in -01001, which are found iu
