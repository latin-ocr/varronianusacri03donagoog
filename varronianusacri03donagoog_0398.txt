And, what is still more singular, we find even illoec, dre. These

of “here” and “near to the here” are fully supported by their
etymology.

- An euelysis of the third indicative pronoun illc leads to
results quite aa interesting ss that of tha other two. There
cannot be any doubt that ille, “that other,” and aliea, “methea‘'

only different forms of ona aud'the same words and thus the
double tof itta will belong to the same sonu of assimilation as
the Greek synouym ἄλλος (Νοιο Oratpl. ξ 215). The other

the Latin ol- aud ol· are successive extenuatione of the original
