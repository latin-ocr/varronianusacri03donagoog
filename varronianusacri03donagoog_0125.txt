(e) The sibilant llis peculiar to the Umbrians. In the Latin
transcription it is osten represented by the combination rs.
Sometimes, however, it seems to stand sor εἰ, asin fistir’a = ces·
tias‘a,· and it also serves as the ultimate assibilation of a dental
or guttural‚ for ter'a = derra and tesca = dacco are connected with
dato and dextra Its real pronunciation was probably similar
to that of d, which last occurs only twice iu the Eugubine
Tables. The frequent substitution of r for d in Latin indicates
’ a change to that letter through the sostened dental θ, and we often
lind ri where we should expect a dental, as in fiarent :flereat
kapite :capside adceitu=advehitn dac. Although Ii is some·
times represented hy rs, we also occasionally find this letter fol·
lowed hy a, as in the words eatar'stcmu, meis, which in the
Latin character are written etcrstadmc, mers. ·

ᾗ 4. Some rethorica on the other letters.

Of the other letters it will not be necessary to say much.
The most remarkable is the Oscan vowel t, which in the inscrip-
tions appears as a mutilated Γ or the first half of 11 ; thus, l·.
The same figure was adopted by the emperor Claudius to express
the middle souud between ί and a with which the Romans pro·
nouuced such words as circen, cepere, and ambae. In Oecan
it appears to have been either a very light ι’ (aud so distin·
guished from the vowel 1, which generally represents the longi
of the Romans), or else a very short a. Iu the Oscan inscriptions
tis of more frequent occurrence than ι’. Whenever these vowels
‘ come together, i always precedes. I is almost invariably used to
form the diphthongs cc, at, ei, answering to the Greek οι (ῳ),
ω (ᾳ), and εις aud ivery rarely appears before two consonante.

The Oscan letter U' stands to υ in the same relation as this l
to the Oscan 1. The former seems to be a sort of very light o,
which is substituted ior it in those inscriptions which are written
in the Latin characters; whereas the letter u seems to represent
the long o of the Latine, as in -am (Gr. -arvl for -crrcm, titt-tud
sor labe-to, kcatsstnr ior quoeamr, dcc.
