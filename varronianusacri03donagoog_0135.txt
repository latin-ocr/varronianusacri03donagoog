p. 364, Miiller¹3 and veru was the Oscan synonym for pleae
atrum (Festus, p. 368, Miller). It is, therefore, not unreason·
able to suppose, that the soree soene furnished an entrance to
the Ocrie or citadel for trebloe ,· that through the fores teaeaulces
the statues of the gods were conveyed to their puluinar in
oemae ,· and thet the fores valrain allowed the larger chariots to
enter in triumphal or festive processioa. In the Latin Tuble
the adj. derived from team or tenea ends in -oa, ocia, like oelou ,·
in the Umbrian it ends in -aa, ecch, like cupae. Austeoht and
Kirehhoff, to whom the true explanation ol umus is due, sup-
pose a quadrangular ¹citadel with one side closed, and the other
three opening with gates called by the names of the citios to
which they led. But this mode of designation is not borne out
by the names of the three gates, if there were only three, iu the
Romu Quadrata on the Palatine. These gates were called the
Portu Romanula Janaatu, end Marione, and lay to the W„
N .W., and N. (Miller, Etruria 11. p. 147). Whatever the names
meant, it is clear that they are not designatione of towns to which
the gates led Aa there were no cities called Trebia and Tesana,
and as Veii was too far off to give a name to one of tha gates
of Iguuium, it is much more reasonable to suppose that the
entranoes refer to the names of carriages with which they are
so easily identified. To say nothing of the analogy of the French
porte metue, which actually denotas uae porte meaa praede
pour donner eante aaa cocles oa coituras, it is well known that
the ancianis measured read-ways ·by the kind of carriages which
traversed them, or by the number of such carrieges which could
pass abreast. Thus we have ὁδὸς timearis for a wide· road
