ξι] anaarsrs or rna mam mensam. 303

The ablativa or adverbiel n has become ιι in longinquus, pro-
pinquae from lonqe[d], prope[d]; compare antiquata, porticae,

from camo, posteo, emim from anso (amno), &c In the cor·

ruption Catamitus from Ganymedea, heth ιι and ι) are changed

into r, and in rodrocus from appilfflwe have th'c converse <r ..
change from Β to 1). nis dropt when flanked by two vowels,

as ea for ede, cst for odit, case foradarc, itemfor itidem, dic.

So also the dental liqnids L and rt are liahle to excision· ‚compare

via= vo th, and the nnmbcrless omissions of the final -otas in

fitero =,fitaront raqnc= -repaont

The change from o to Rhas been often pointed out, in such
common instanecs as coena compared with aod-io, aporior epod,
meritae for madiis dr'c, car-vocat for edoceat, &a The verb ar-
cceso, which is also written accerso, fumishes a double example
of the change: the original form was edred-meccedem sciro:
in cremae the first d is changed into r, and the second assimi-
lated to a: in ιιιιινιο the first d is assimilatcd to c, and the
second changed tor. In the Romancc langnagc n ischanged
into Β in the Spanish lampone from lampada, and conversely in
the Italian rado from raro, fida'ra from fert'rc5 compare the
English poddoclr torpacion, A.-S. lor port.

As a final letter, n became more and more liahle to proscrip-
tion. With the exception ol the proclitics ad and oprrd, sorne-
times written ct or ot and apat, ar and apen· the conjunction
scd, also written aet,· and the adverb taad also written haut aad
cat (cs. autam), wc have no ι) in amicat in classical Intinity.
In the ablativo, ι) was absorbcd before the rise of Roman litera·
ture, and -od for -ad or -art in tho nentcr plural was finally re·
presented by -ἄ only.

N is principally remarkable in Latin from its use as a sort
of ιιιιιιιυᾶναΙι (see N. Orat. §223). In this use it is inserted,
generally before the second consonant ol the root, as in modo,
root tod- ,· jin-do, root fid, &c.; but sometimes after it, as in ⁴
ster-oo, root stan, atro- ,· aper-no, root spere, sprc- ‚- ιιὶιι-ο,
root ιιῑ, dre. This nasal insertion is found in modern transitione
as when the chamoxlrye (χαμαίδρυς), ie. the qwmla or “ speed· {A --ν ι
wcll” is called pantander or permandet.

conversely, ιι becomes evanescent in certain cases, partion-
larly before sand v. Thus omreul is written cosol (abbreviated
