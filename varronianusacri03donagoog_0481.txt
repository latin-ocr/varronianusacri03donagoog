Umbrian Propertius (lv, 246) expressly tells us that the name
of Vertumnus was explicable in the Etruscan language ; ior
he says:
At mihi, quod formas uuus uertebar in omnes,
Nomen ab eventu patrio ῑὶνφνν dedit,-
aud that this potra'u liapua must be Etruscan (i. e. in this case
Pelasgian) ia clear from the beginning of the Elegy (v. 3) ε
Tuscus ego, et Tuscis orlor: nec poenitet inter
Proelia Volsinios deseruisse focos.

And Varro expressly tells us that he was a chief divinity with
those Etruscans who came with Coeles Vibenna (L. L. v. 46,
p. 18, Mallon: “ab iis dictus Vicus Tuscus, et ideo ibi Ver-
, tumnnm stare, qnod is Deua Etruriae princeps.” From this we
learn that the Pelasgian religion was peculiarly distinguished by
its elementary character (above, p. 44), and that ver-to, and
consequently auo-to, were Pelasgo-Tyrrheniam words. In its
middle sense, vertor often appears in the compound re-oertor,
“ Ι turn myselt' back or return.'’ The verb repo, which, as we
have seen (above, p. 91), has important affinitiea with the Greek,
Sclavonian, and even the Semitio langnages, is never used as a

deponent to signify motion in a straight line, like the Greek ’

ἔ-ρχ-ομαν, nor is it used as a neuter verb like τ-ρέχω, and yet
the term rapio} or rapio vabrum expressly denotes the straight
course or direction, like the ἀνομένων βημάτων ὅ-ρεγμα oi
AEschylus (Olotpli. 799). The omission of the vowel in tha
root-syllableof ἔ-ρχ-ομαι, is paralleled by tho similar omission in
arr-ryo for mab-rgo, per-po and emper-piscor for percipo and
smper-riy-iacor, por-'po for por-rapo: of. also surpa'o for suh-rapio.
The uncompounded verb layo has the perfect leps, which is un·
doubtedly a temnant of reduplication3 but in the derivative forms,
such as intel-lips, “I make a discrimination,” i. e. I understand,
diluo, “I make a choioe,’‘ i. e. Ι prefer or love, περ-Ζίριν, “I
make no option,” i. e. I leave behind neglected, we have only
the aorist in -εἱ, as inalbat, daim, naphaei. But we have also
intellegi, neyleyi, and conversely collari, in the older writers (see
Lachmann, ad Iaceret vl. 17) This aorist revives the lost gut·
tural of the present tense in fluo, fluaei, in atrito, struxi, iu eino,
oiri, andin fruor, fluctus sam ,- and strengthens an ultimate
guttural in hubo, trucci, and velo, oeci.
