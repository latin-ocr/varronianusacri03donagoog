πίω, aava struo, struxi ,· vivo, orbi. The last is a double in·
stanee3 for there can be no doubt of the connexion between
:rs-9 “puch” and vivore (for qer'qoue) (Nero Orat. §112,note).
' Bopp's opinion, therefore (Verpleich. Gramen. pp. 18, 98), that
there is some natural connexion between v aud le in themselves,
is altogether unfounded.

In the comparison between Latin and Senserit we seldom
find that etis represented by a Senserit x, but that it usually
stands in cognate words where the Senserit has a palatel or
sibilant (Nero Orat. 5105, tle: compare quatuor, Sanscr.
οἰκιέων) a-qaama, Sanscr. chhud, “ tegere;” quamtitas, Senser.
elra', “ accumulare ;” oc-cuttna (oh-qaudaa), Sanscr. jal, “tegere ;'’
aequor, Senser. aayyy pepone, Sanscr. ἕως equus, Sanscr. apoc,
dcc. When Qv stands hythe side of a Senserit t, it is
either when that letter is followed by e or i-in which case
the guttura] approximates to the palatal,-or when the fastands
before e or v. There are seme instanees in which the Q. is re-
presented by the labialP in Greek and Sanscrit3 and thiais
particularly remarkable in cases where the Q, occurs twice in the
Latin word: compare the Latin quinque, quoquo (coquo), equa,
loquor, dre, with the Senserit and Greek panchea, πέμπε, pach,
πέπω, dpah (pl), lup, dre.; also equus, optatae aequor, h'aquo, ''
dte, with ἵππος, ὄμμα, ἕπομαι, λείπω, dre. μ’ “ “’

Quiritiliad says that the Latin Q is derived from the Greek
κόππα (1. 4,· § 9); and there can be ne doubt that they have a
common origin. Now this Greek κόππα, which is of rare oe·
currenee,'is found, where it occurs in Greek inscriptions, only
before ο. Thus we hare φορινθοθεν (Bsekh, 0. Ι. no. 29), ὄρφον
(n. 37), λυφοδορκας (n. 166); and on coins we have φορινθος,

’ Συραφοσιων, dre. The explanation of this issimple: the letter
obelore a vowel expressed the sound of w, so far as the mouth
of a Greek could convey this mund: compare οἶστρος, ῥοῖβδος,
which imitate the whizzc‘np neises of the wings of the gad-ily
and the bird; da which represents the Persian lamentation wa!
dre. (abore, p. 58). Consequently, the syllable φο must be
regarded as the residuum of a syllable pronounced lewa, which
was probably the pronunciatiou of the Latin Q„ At any rate,
it is sufficiently evident from the single word huochopxna that
φ sud κ could not have been identieal at the time when the
