ω, and elo, for which M was subsequently written3 and the
same remark applies to the still higher numbers.

If, then, the Roman ciphers were derived from the Tuscana,
it is obvious that we must scel< in the Tuscan languagc for an
interpretation. Now it cannot be doubted} that the Tuscan
numeral signs are either letters of the alphabet slightly changed,
or combinatione of such characters made according to fixed mles.
Thus, A is the invented V= u ,· φ or T is an inverted «t = olr¹ ,-
and 8=f Since, therefore, the position of these letters in the
orgenic alphabet does not correspond to their value as numeral
signs, we must conclude that they represent the initials of the
numerals in the Etruscan, just as M afterwards denoted mille in
the Latin language. We do not positively lrnow any Etruscan
numeral, and therefore cannot pretend to any certainty on this
subject3 but this is the most probablc inference. The manner in
which the elementary signs arc combined to form the intermediate
numerals is more easily and safely investigated. The character
denoting unity is perhaps selected hom its simplicity; it is the
natural and obvious acore in every country. This character is
combined with itself to form the next three digits, though four is
sometimes expressed as 5- 1, according to the principle of sub-
traction so common among the Romans (comp. dudeapinri, dee).
The same plan is adopted to form the numerals between 5 and
10. The number 10 is represented by a combination of two V‘s
„thee X; and this figure enclosed in a circle indicates the
multiplication of 10 by itself, or 100. The letter 8, or Φ, being
assumed as the representative of 1000, its half, or D, would
indicate 5003 and as multiplicatiora by ten was indicated bya

circle in the case of 100, on the same principle (Φ) would be

10,000, and its half or D) would represent 5000.
These rules for the formation of one numeral from another

are moro obvious than the origin of the elementary numeral ·

signs. But where certainty is not within our reach, we must be
contented with a solution of those difficulties which may be sub-

mitted with safety to a philological analysis.

lit is possible that this character may be the balf of that which
denotas 10⁰, according to the principle stated below.
