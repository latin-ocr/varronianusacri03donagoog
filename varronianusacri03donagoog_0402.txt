ferred to an inversiones so, but may bear the same relation to
-pac that the original supinos in -tnm do to the secondary forms
in -saca, Ι fall back on the other explanation, and consider ·ptr
an indeclinable affix, analogous to ποτε, which has been sostened
into φορ, perhaps from an original assimilaticn in alr-pte (cf.
δίσκος for δίκ-σκος, λέσχη from λὲγ-σκη, dre).

- The declension of is, ejas, reminds us at onee of Iri-c, hu·
jus, and itis clear that the former is only a wecker modifica-
tion of the latter, just aethe Greek t is of the older i‘(Ncw
Orat. ἓ 139). The most striking differenees in the inflexione of
’ἵε and tie are entirely due to the -c or -ce appended tc the lct-
tm, and there is reason to believe that this affix, which appears
attached to all the indicative pronouns, was originally appended
also to tho distinetive is and the relative qni. Indead, ae qni,
iri-e, lei-c and r‘s are successive degeneratione of one and the
same form, there is no reason to exclude from the first and last
the strengthening appendage which so constantly appears with
the two intermediate words. To say nothing of the alleged
occurrence of euch forme ae cis-ce (Plaut. Mercct. prol. 91),
ejus-ee (Aul. Gell. lenm.c.x1v.l. 111), cajus-ce (Cic. de In·
vect. 11. 45, ξ 134), dre, the original appendage of -cato the
neuter plurale at least of rc and qai may be proved by the sol-
lowing induction. Where the accus. nent. pl. of c'e becomes fined
in combination with certain propositione, ae in inter-ed, post-cd,
preter-cci, dre, the d is long. Itis therefore fair to conclude
that, when these compounde were formed there was some reason
for the length of the plural ἄ, which, as e general rule, is short
in all Greek and Latin words. Now we find in Latin poet-law
poet-lacae, praeparvamque-propter, and mcci rffert=meoe rei
fert. Therefere ᾶ may represent ce. And as post-Intc, qan-

proptcr are entirely analogoue to posted, prgctcreh it iollovvs ¹

that the neuter plural osia was anciently eos, just aa the neuter
plurale of bic and qai vvere Irae-c and quus. But aa = ai, therefore
eoe, and que stand ior cri-i, qadia'r and as the neuter plural ltoec can ’
only be explained as a residuum of hit-ca or lid-cah the final ἰ in
the two other cases must represent alost guttural fulcrum. This
view ie confirmed by the fact that the Oscan represents post-ed
under the form poet-eset (above, p. 145); and the same ex·
