But oi all the legal fragments which exhibit the prt'acu
camma verborum (cie. de Oratore, 1. c. 43), the most copious, aa
well aa the most important, are the remains of the Twelve
Tables, of which Cicero speaks in such enthusiastic, if not
hyperbolieal lnngnage These fragments have been more than
onec collected and explained. In the following extracta I have
followed the textos Dirksen (Ueberaioht der buhen'pen Veraacho
aar Krt'tt'k aad Heratelluap das Teates derdelf- Tasci-Fragmenta).
The object, however, df Dirksen's elaborate work isjuristic¹
rather than philologiea13 whereas I have only wished to present
these fragments as interesting specimens of old Latinity.

It was probably the intention of. the decemvirs to comprise
their system in six double Tables; for each successive pair of
Tables seems to refer to matters which are naturally classed
together. Thus Tab. 1. and 11. relate to the lepis ochema· Tab.
111. and lv. to the mancipium, potestas, and maaca, or the rights
which might be required over insolvent debtors, the right of a
father over his aon, and of a husband over his wife3 Tab. v. and
v1. to the laws of guardianship, inheritance and property ς Tab.
vu. audiunto obligatione, deltam and crimina· Tab. 1x. and
x. to the juo prcblicnm and jar accrum Tab. xr. and x11. were
supplementary to the ten former Tables, both in subject and in

aa.
