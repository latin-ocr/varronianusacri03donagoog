in -c·aa', eei, or ·r⁰·sr'. We shall ses that there are rerba in ·ao
and -r'o, which drop their characteristic, and have perfecta in -sr'
immediately attached to the root ; but though the characteristic
is sometimes dropt in -o verbs, rs in derisa A. III. domni,
Il. III. domitus, and though, when the root ends in c, the a of
the perfect is absorbed and represented only bya lengthening
of the verbsyllable‚ as in jrivo, A. ΙΙΙ. juo-i, E. III. pit-tus, we
never find an -a verb which exhibite the cordat-perfect in -sai
Why this tense has vanished in the first Latin conjugation it is
difficult to say, unless we must conclude that it was not eupho-
nious or convenient in the eleven short words, which elide the
characteristic -a, and in which alone it was possible. These are
crepo, com, diruo, ji-ieo, mlco, πέσο, plico, seco, ebro, trino, otto. ·
If we compare these words with the Greek verbs in -ao, which
have a short a before the -c of the future, we may he led to con·
clude that in these inatanoes also the a was originally followed
hy some consonant which has been ahsorbed, and the short
vowel in the penultima favours the supposition that we have
here the remnants of longer forms. Thus calui belongs to cando,
which ia strengthened hy caasadro, as well as to atla-o, which,
like κύπτω, may have hed some consonantal formative: adpo-o,
crepui, may be compared with crrrpo, strepui, which has alto-
gether lost the pronominal adjunct of itav present tense: dboce
stands by the side of &ip-mppr as' well as δαμὼζ . I have
shown elsewhere (Journal ofPhiloloyy, 11. p. 353) that ceto,
properly “to warn off,” is another form of vtto=ve·ito, “to
avoid.'' These verbs bear a relation the converse of caclo, coedo,
“laih'’ ‘⁴ fell? but the distinction of meaning is equally affected
by the rocaliaafion, and they are both derived from ve· and tho
frequentatives of al, “ to go.’' The noun vitiam hears the same
‚affinity to aeto that pretim ερον-ἰείη, ‘⁶ that which changes ,
hands,’‘ bears to interpretat “to be an interpres or go-between”
(below, Oh. 1111. § 10). The verb mico, considered as a deri·
votive, has a special interest for the philologer. 1 have no hesi-
tation in connecting this word with the root μαχ- found in
Λά-μαχος, μάχ-ομαι, prix-arpa, A. S. macc, Ο. S. mone, Ο. N.
moelrer, “e sword” (Grimm, Decreta Granum. 11. 511; 111. 440),
a root of such antiqnity that it was iinported into Palestine in the
reign of David by his Oarion mercenarios (Olrrhtr'aa Ortlodcay,
