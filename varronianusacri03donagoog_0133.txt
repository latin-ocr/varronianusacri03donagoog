used on the occasion, and also dwell at greater length on the
auguriea tc be employed, &c The first Table begins aa follows:

Este persklum ovea oazeriotes caeto, 2. pervenies
panacea

And in VI. a, 11, vve have:

Este peralto coeio aseriatev 00010.

There nan be little doubt as to the meaning of these vvords.¹
Este, which ia of constant recurrence in the Tables, is the
Umbrian adverb corresponding to ita, which is only a weaker
form 01 it Ι1 we may infer that per-oletum or peralclo :prep-
oulom‚ we may render thia word “a prayer.” (10010100ᾶᾶ0-
rives the noun from purgo, and translates it by “lustrum”
But par-pois a compound 01 panta and 090 (comp. castello, hc),
whereas the root pere, signifying “ pray,’¹ is of constant occur·
rence in Umbrian3 and every one, however slightly conversant
with etymology, understands the metathesis in a case 01 this
kind. It is the same root as prec- or proc· in Lat, perep- in
Zend, praohh'· in Sanscr„ freq-ea in Germ„ dcc.

Itis clear-that ovea 0000010ίο0 01· 00010 demetet· are ab-
lativos absolute. Aa vve have ova‘f 0001ιο or 000001ιὺ0 (vl. b, 48,
49.1.b‚ 11, dcc.) by the side of salvem aeriter (vl. a, 51, dec),
and as this last is manifestly salvom 0000010, it ispretty clear
that ovea anzm‘otea must be equivalent to aethrae damaso
(5100000101).

Erretu is clearly the imperative of daeo, for fvt-ito ; the pre·
position had the form ea=a⁰a in old Latin3 thus we find in the ,
Uolum Rostrata: eaque eodem mocchtratod: and the same was
the case in Oscan, which gives us em-hratrtr for iot-perator.

The adjectivae pemoa'ea, pomaeo, are derived from per-tte,
poetae, vvhich are locative forms 01 the prepositions proe and
post, and signify “at the southern and northern side of the
temple.’' The birds are so defined with reference to the practice
of the augura in such casea See Varro, L. L. v11. § 7, p. 119,
Mdller: “ quocirca caelum, qna attuimur, dictum templum...
Ejus templi partes iv. dicuntur, 01001100 ab oriente, dentre ab
occasu, anteco ad meridiem, poetica ad septentrionem.”

The meaning of the whole passage will therefore be: Ito
