That the Saturnian metro was either a native oi Italy, or
naturalizod there at a very early period, has been sufficiently
shown by Lord Macaulay (Laye osherem Rom, p. 23). Itis,
perhaps, not too much to say, that this metro-which may be
defined in its pure form as a brace of trochaic tripodiae, preceded
by an maurusia—is the most natural and obvious of all rhyth-
mical intonations. There is no langunge which is altogether

without it; though, of course, it varies in eleganca aud harmony p

with the particular languages in which it is found, and with the

degree of literery advanoement possessed by the poets who have η

written in it. The Umbriaus had this verse aa well as the
Latins3 at least there ean be no doubt that the beginning of the
Ἦ. Eugubine Table is pervaded by a Saturnian rhythm, though
the lawa of quantity, which the Latine horrowed from the
Greeks, are altogether neglected in it. The following may serve

aa a sample:

‘Este' perrklt aveto atatridter cereta

Persa Ῐοιινηάοο (ἰένουο Ι petqa pstea mirata,

Pili duplo άεοοίάιο est Ι teo temno reae.
, These verses are, in fact, more regular than many of the Latin
specimens. The only rule which can be laid down for the
genuine Latin Saturnian is, that the ictus must occur three times
in each member of the verse1, and that any theare, except the
last, may he omitted (see Muller, Suppl. Annot. ad Fert. p. 396).
The amentata, at the beginning of the line, is often necessary iu
languages which, like the Latin and our own, have but a few
words beginning with an ictus. When the Greek metres be·
came established among the Romans, it would seem thet the con·
ventional pronunciation of many words was changed ιο suit the
exigencies of the new versificatiou, and no line began with au
auacrusis, unless it had thet commencement in the Greek model:

but thia appears not ιο have been the case iu the genuine Roman
reram, which begin with an unemphatic thesis whenever the

Italian metra 1 would refer tbe word tripudium=triplcr pulsatio. Pudio
meant “ to atrike with the soot,'’ “ ιο spurn’' (comp. νο-ροᾱίο). 'l'ho fact
is alluded to by Horace, 3. Germ. xvm. 16: “ guadet invirum pepulisse
tonsor tar pede terram?
