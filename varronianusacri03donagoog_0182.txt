The substantive tem and its possessive tedas must be explained
with reference to the root cer·, cre· (creare), Sanscr. ert, “to

malre‚'' which we find in Oeace and Oem=crectcr, Festus,
p. 122. Το the same class of deitics belongs Futrrlo' (root φυ-,

fir), audit is a matter of indifference whether Venae or Ocres
comes nearest to the goddess intended. Kn'o'tel'identifies Evklus
with Iphiclus, and of course this is possihle; but the adjunct

patri in 1. 25, seems to denote a deity analogous to Lr'ber Ῑ
Pater (ef. Mssa).- Ammo corresponds‚ as Aufrecht suggests, to 1
the Germ. omme, Sanscr. nuta, “mother’' On diurnparh=lym= ¹
pltris, which is compared with the Senserit dap zsalqcra aplea

the authorities quoted hy Fabretti (p. 317). Vereltccr'us, as an
epithet of Jupiter, is explained by the Sanscr. ortdt, “ to grow,¹’
whence the Latin νίτρῳ· and reputor must be reputor, i. e. plu·

above, Ohap. 11. ἓ 11). Akewus is wacca, as in Umbrian (see
Aufrecht u. Kirchhoff, Umdr. Sprd. p. 401). Perna is Pales

§ 7. The Atellam. ’

It seems scarcely worth while to enumerate the grammatieal
forms which may be collected from these inscriptions, as they
are virtually the same with those which occur in the oldest spe-
cimens cf Latin, the only important differences being that we
have -czum for -arum in the gen. pl. ofthe·1stdecl.‚ that the
3rd doelension sometimes preserves the original -ss of the nom. pl.,
and that this reduplication represents the ahsorbed m in the
ace. pl. of the hnd and ‚3rd declensions. It may be ¹desirable¹
