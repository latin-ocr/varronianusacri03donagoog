§L wa Latia Verb qenerally defictive.

HE'forms oi the Latin verb are nreagre and scanty in the
earne proportion aa the cases oi the nouns are multifarioue
and comprehensive. The defieiencies of the one are due to the
earne cauae ae the copioueneee of the other. They both spring

from the antiquated condition of the language. An idiom which ,

hae beon long employed in literature will generally substitute
propositione for the inflexione of cases, and, by the employment
of various syntaotical devieee, increase the expressivenese and
significance of the verb. It ie just in these particulare that the
dialecto formed from the Latin differ from their mother-speech,
and in the earne particulare they approximate to the syntectical
dietinctneae of the Greek.

The Latin percon-audinga are, however, on the whole, lese

than in Greek. .
