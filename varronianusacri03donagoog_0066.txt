that‘we have here a Mithruic symbol². This supposition springs
from a total misoonception of the object which stands between
tho lions, and ufforde no explanation of their duality. It can be
shown, on the contrary, that it must be intended to indicate that
the two lords of Mycenae, some tuin-power or duumvirate there,
had conquered some place distinguished hythe architectura of
which the inverted column is a specimen. Whether the cir·
cumstance thus commemorated bc a fact or a legend, we can
’ hardly doubt that the two lions represent the two Αινοίᾱο or
sons of Atreus, the Pelopid or Lydo-Pelasgian prince of Mycenae¹,
and that the city captured and overthrown, the plunder of which

they had stored up in their treasure-house, was the sar-famed ,
Troy. 'Both the duality of the conquerere of Troy, and the ¹
symbol of tho lions as applied to them, arc distinctly recorded l
in the Αροοιοοιοοο of AEschylus⁸. If this explanation is correct, 3
the inverted column represents Asiatic architecturam opposed =

to the style of building then common in Graece and Italy, and
which we call Cyclopcsn. From this inverted fragment we can
restore the whole faoede‘, and we see that it conuins the ele·

monuments. Now Pindar says that the Corinthiens, among
