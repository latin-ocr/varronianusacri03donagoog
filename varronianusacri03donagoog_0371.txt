CHAPTER IX.
DEOLENSIONS OF THE LATIN N OUN.

5¹· The usual arrangement is emoneous. §a Gener-al rules for the classification
of Latin nonna. 53. First or -a declcnsion. 94. Second or -c declamion.

55. Third decieneion or consonantal noune. 56. A. First clamor purely
consonante} noune. l 7. B. Second class or semi-consonantal nouus.

ξ 1. The ιιοιιαῑ awaopement is erroneam.

HE arrangement of Latin nonns in different deciensions (κλί-

σεις) or forms of inflexion has been managed hy grammarians
without any regard either to the internal organisation of the
word or to the real convenience of the learner. Among the
ancient grammarianS, Varro proposed a simple convention-
namely‚ to distinguish the deciensions of noune according to the
vowel of the ablative singular (L. L. x. 62, p. 257, Mitllerlz

“nam ejus caesnia literarum discriminibus facilius reliquorum
varietatem discernere poterit, qnod ei habent exitus, autin A, ut
hao'terrd: ant in E, ut haelenae: aut in l, ιιι hac leui: autin
O, ut hoc coelo: autin U, ut hoc ocrea Igitur ad demonstrandas
declinationes vice prima haec.” Diomedes distinguished seven
deolensions, dividing the nouns in -ίιιο, -ιοιιι from those in -ιιι,
-eom, and the neuters in -ιι from the femininos in -οι (see Zeitschr.
fi d. Wies. d. Spr. 111. 315). The favourite and oldest method
in this country hae been to consider the noun according ιο five
distinct declensions. The -a and -o deciensions stand in their
proper place at the head of the list. Thon follow the conso·
nantel and -e' declensions considered as one. And the noune in
-u and -e are treated as two distinet schcmes of case-formatione.
One of the objecta, which Ι proposed to myself in writing a new
Latin Grammar¹‚ was to correct this vicione and faulty exhibi-
tion of the different forms of the noun3 bnt as Ι could not
attempt in a merely elementary treatise to explain and justify
