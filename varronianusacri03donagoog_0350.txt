ΗΕ system of cases, with which the Latin noun is samuhel,

presente a greater abundanee and variety of forms than that
ol tha Greek declension. The Greek noun has no distinct ablativa
case; its accusative has frequently lost its characteristic termina-
tion ; 'the genitive includes the ablativo meaning3 and the loca·
tive is almost obsolete. The mester number and variety of the
Latin cases is ducto the more ancient state or condition of the
language‚ ¹and perhaps also to its composite structura As the
language degenerates inu> the ao·called Romanoa idioma, we find
that its cases are gradually lost, and their place taken hya
number of prefixes, which add indeed to the mactat distinct·
neas of the language‚ hut purchase this advantage by sacrificing
the etymologica] development. The student of Latin, however,
very soon discovers that the variety of case-forms is the very
reverse of an advantage. For idiomatic usage has introduced so
much confusion into the use of the genitive, dative, and ablativa,
that the two latter derive all their distinctions from the preposi-
tions attached to the ablativo, while the genitive, in many cases,
differs from the ablative only as an arbitrary form, and without
· any reference to a distinctiones meaning. If we revert to the
Greek language‚ which still retains themora accurate distinmions
of ease, we shall see that the genitive, or case of ablation, denotas
the origin of motion or action; the dative, or case of accession,
denotes juxta-position, immediate proximity‚ rest and presence3
the accusative, or case ol transition, denotas the end ol motion
