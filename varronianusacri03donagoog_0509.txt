above (p. 477), show that the origin cf the abstract noune in -r‘s,
-ut, tia, dtu, may be tracad back to the supine in -tum and the

infinitiva in -aa (cf. Nara Orat, §de ( )).

That in all the nouns in -o[u] thc ἰοί the genitive -r'ou'is
absorbed, may be proved by an examination of the abstraot
nouus in -or, such as amor, fauor, honor, doc. For no one will
doubt that the Latin comparative ending -iorzrbrus is equivalent
to the Greek -rov=sou-e. Now the termination -or is inexplica-
blc except aa an abbreviation of -iou Therefore, pari aarum, ,
-on must be an abbreviation of -r'ora Itis obvious that this
view accords exactly with the meaning of such a noun ss amor,
which, as we shall ses, results from a· consonant verb amo=amo,
and leads to the vowel-verb umo=umao. And thus amor:
our-iores means the act of choosing and selecting. Similarly,
jauor=fuuioaa which leads to the verb focco, must have come
from the root duh, and, like yle-lia, faustus, it oonveys the
idea's of light and happiness. The noun tou-or eanum be re-·
ferred to any primary verb in Latin, bnt it is not at all difficult
to discover its Indo-Germanic affinities. It may be referred at
once to the Senserit root uon, “ to love and serve,’' Greek fora,
in ὀν-ίνημι, dcc, German wira (minnan, Grsff, Ι. 875). It thus
denotes any kind of gain or profit, and the estimation of others,
howeyer expressed, is convcyed in ‚the meaning of the abstract
honor. Another form, indicating tho concrete result, is ouua=
aaut, and with all their differences of application horreatur and
onus-tua lall back to a common origin. This will not surprise
any one who knows that the Hebrew πῃ not only bears every

signification of honour and dapnity, but alab denotas waiyht, with
all its subordinate ideas of difficulty and trouble. We therefore
see that as fauor· implies lr'pht and ohaufitluaaa, as elementa of
happiness, honor expresses some more solid and weighty ad·
juncts of pposperity-dbrlvarou «γὰρ ἢ οὐ ῥᾴδιον τὰ καλὰ πράτ-
τειν ἀχορήγητον ὄντα (Arist. Eth. Nic. 1. 9, 15). Or if wc pre·
fer to connect it with the idea of estimation, we may remember
. that τι-μή signifies merely patting a price upon something, and ’
thatun-timodenotes avaluation hythe standard of weight (above,
p. 313). And thus the Romans would reckon personal distinction
by weight (honor), by space filling the eye (amplus), and by the

voice of fame orcupying the ear (olam, plurib, κλέος, dtu), , “
