words denoting egency, arid thus bring these noune to an agree·
ment with the longer extensions in -tera’um and mm. Writers
on Latin etymology, who have not fully studied the subject, or
are deficient in the tect which verbal criticism presumes and
requires, have been in the habit of explaining noune in -trum es
denoting always the instrument or means of doing3 and one of
these incompetent philologists has actually ventured on the ab·
surdity of proposing (Proc. quhr'lol. Soc. 11. p. 249) that as
mcum costra, ponere casua are common phrases, the watra
must have been the axes which the soldiers carried with them

for the purpose of falling trees to fenoe their enoampmenti To ’

say nothing of the fact that castrum and woradum both occur
in the singular to denote an inclosed place oi security, and that
they may be explained with reference to the root of oasa, “a
house,'’ cas-tus, “ religiously pure and protested from externel
contact,’' κάσ-τωρ, “a mailed warrior,’' dcc. (Nero Orat. § 267)¹,
it is not the fact that “the suffix -tram denotes always the in-
strument.’' If,.which is nearly certain, it is only a weaker form
of -en'em or doraum, we should infer from this analogy, that all
these nouns denote a thing, whether place or object, considered
with reference to a certain agenoy. We cannot always traoe
these secondary words to a noun signifying an agent, or to a
verb from which such a noun might be derived: bnt it is clear
in every case that this is the involved or implied meaning. The
following'are nearly all the nouns in tram: ara-tram, “a place
for going up’' (cf. βάρα-θρον with dv-rpov, and, for the root,
Favd, υοη-ἱο, dre.); ura-trum, “a thing for ploughing” (cf. aro-
tor); cos-trum, “a place for enclosing” (κάζω); obuersam, “a
thing for shutting” (rhodon fenea-tra, “a thing for giving
light ;” fere-trum, “a thing· for carrying'' (fer-ok flagae-trum,
“a thing for flashing” (iq. fulgur„ loro-trum, “a thing for
drawing” (haur-io) 3 mon-s-trum, “a thing for pointing at ;'’ mudr-
trum, “a' thing for milking’' (melpach ras-trum, “a thing for
soraping” (rad-o); ros-trum, “a thing for gnawing or cutting”
(rod-o, cf. securis, 1173,de above, p. 90); rar-trum, “a thing
