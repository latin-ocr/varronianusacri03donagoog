and pree to mark a definite object, as contrasted with anas and
aliquae-tanus, which denote indifference This ie, of course,
·identical with the use of the definitive article in the Greek and
other languages3 and the Romanae languagee owe much of their
’ acknowledged perspicuity to this adaptation. Itis true thatthe
artifice is not applied with the logical subtilty by which the
employment of the Greek article ie distinguished3 bnt any
deficiency in this respect is amply compensated by the strictly
logical order of the sentences in which the words are arranged.

. Ι It is not necessary in this place to say much on the subject
of the Romanoa verb. Where the tenses have preserved the
forms of the Latin verb, wc observe a systematic abbreviation.
Labins are absorbed, according to the practice eo remarkable in
Latin: final syllables are dropt‚ and the accent ie thrown for·
ward. We sometimes find that what appears to be an arbitrary
corruption is really only an attempt to represent in writing some
:genuine articrrletion of the old Ietin3 thus we have seen above
(p. 290) that a paletal may take the plac‘e of a labial in French,
¹when the latter is followed by i, asin aaprbm=sapjam, Fr.
-saclre (cf. rear‘r and arrecta from rapti> and emptio). We see
the process of this change in the Provencal. Thus, we have

in the celebrated prison-song of Richard cemes-Lien:

⁴⁶ Or repeton ben miei hom e miei baron
· Englea Norman, Peytario, e (lacoon,
Qu’ ieu non ai jn si pauore companbom .

The a, which represents the Latin eia in -the second person
plural of all present tenses of French verbs, except in the cases of
etos and faites for estis and sacitrir, is not equivalent to ta,
as some have supposed, but stands for the' dentalsibilant, which
followed the t in the older Romance lengnages3 thus we have
coambulandi before we find avae, anderen eta forestis before

tres. Thata ie merely an s, so written atter -ι, is clear from its
