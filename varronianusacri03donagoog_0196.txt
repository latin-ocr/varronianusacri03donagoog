tion. Thus we have AEcealzpim lor Αἰσκλήπιος. But oon-
versely we have the shortened forms visclam, walam, poclum,
meolam, soeclucn, mir-eclam, vehiclum, pubernaclem, and the like,
and Heracleaene is written Hereleneac (see Gorssen Ausepr. Vola.
a. Bet. 11. pp. 6, l). When wc remember that Ἡρακλῆς was
the tutelary god of the Dorium or Herennia-dati, who conquered
the Peloponnese‚ we can hardly avoid identifying him with
Her-mimica. .

If we pass to the consideration of those proper names which
are found in the Latin langimge‚ we shall observe peculiarities
of precisely the same kind. For instance, the medials in Idas,
Thaboaiua Vatiae &a are represented in Etrrrscan by the tennes
in Itur, Tlapani, sipi, dm.; the tenues in Turius, Volcae, duc.
stand for the aspirates in lbere, Fatale, &c ; snd the artictrla-

tion-vowels in Idcinias, Tanaquil, he. are omitted before or ,

after the liquide in Lemcc, Theoclfil, tn. χ

The transcription (haze, for Ὀδυσσεύς, suggests a remark .
which has been in part anticipated in a former chapter. We
see that in tbis case the Etruscan z corresponds to the Greek
-oe, jnst as conversely, in the cases there cited, the Greek -ζ is
represented by -ac in Latin. It was formerly supposed that
this Etruscan z was equivalent to x= KS, and this supposition
was based on a comparison of Utere with Ulyess. To say no-

thing, however, of the mistake, which was made in assuming that y

Utere represented U lyces and not Ὀδυσσεύς, it has been shown
by Lepsius (De Tabe. Eup. pp. 59 sqq.; Anmlt‘ dell' lectitata,
vm. p. 168) both hat the Eumene addedthis a to the guttura
u, as in tranet, dre. and also that, when it was necessary to ex·
prees the Greek ξ, they did not use the letter z, but formed a
representative for it by a combination of Κ or cu with s, as in
Secstinel = Βοπίπία natus and Emisenae: Ἀλέξανδρος. Pa·
laeographical considerations also indicate that the letter corre·
sponded in form, not to for e, but to the Greek z. We ought,
however, to go a step farther than Lepsius has done, and say
that the Latin x was, after all, in one of its valnes, erepresen-
tative of this Etruscan letter. It is true, indeed, that a: does

represent also the combination of a guttural and sibilant; but ,

there are cases, on the other hand, in which e is found in Latin
words containing roots into which no guttural enters: comp. ricc
