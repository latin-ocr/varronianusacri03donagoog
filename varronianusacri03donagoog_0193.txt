work. He now contende that the Etruscan language is com·
ponnded of Armenian and Celtic ingrediente, the former being
to thelatterin the proportiones two tc one, in the list of some
fifty words, which hc borrows from the present chapter¹. The
Celtic clement is to be assigned, he thinks, ιο the Umbrians,
aud he regards all the aboriginal languages of Italy as chiefly
Celtic, but partly Finnish’. The Pelasgian clement, which, with
me, he acels in the Medes⁸, that is, in the Sarmatian or Sclavonic
stads, ,would thus have an affinity with the Rasenic or hstincdve
element in the Etruscan. For the Armenians spolre Persian
even in tho days of Xenophon⁴. As Mr. Ellis admits this affinity,
it seems to mathathia new hypothesis, even if we concede the
results of his comparative philology, would leave out os con-
sideration all those ingrediente in the Etruscan, which heve,
created the philological difficulties of the problem to be selred,
and would leave us no distinction between the Pelasgian Tyr-
seni, whose langnege, aa we shall see, was not altogether unlilre
that of their brethreu in Graece, and the Raetian invaders,
who disintegrated the spoken idiom of the conquered country,
and whose fragmentary records will not find their interpretation

in the voeabulary of any unmixed and comparatively modern
form of human specchl.

‘sister' dialect to the other Italic langusges by means of a certain num-
ber of similar roots, when its entire stnsotuse is so different that it is
impossible even from the eopions inscriptions that romain, tc form a
conjecture as to its mrumst, or do more than guess et the meaning of
some half-desen words.” Imust, in my turn, express my surprise that
Mr. Rawlineon should so entirely misoonceise the state oi the case and
the natme of my attempt as to write such an account of the matter.
'l'he reader oi the present chapter does not need to be told that my
attempt is very different from that described by Mr. Rawlineous and
when we have the notorious fact that the Perngian inscription alone givos
