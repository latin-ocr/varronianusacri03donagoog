sente the female name Atinio (Fabretti, s. vv. Atnci, Atarbl,
p. 204). On a bell-sheped cinerat-y urn, brought to England
from chiusi in N ov. 1846 by Mr. Beckford Bevan, we have the
inscription Lat: Veto: Atecotial, which exhibite a matronymic
form of the same name.

If I do not undertake to interpret allthat Lartius, the son of

Raesia, has thought litto inscribe on this cappos ior the gratifi-
cation of his own immediate relatives, it must not be supposed
that this in any way affecta the results at which I have arrived κ

’ respecting the ethnography of the Etruscans. That an inability ’

to interpret ancient monuments may be perfectly consistent with
a knowledge of the class of langnages to which they belong, is Ἴ

shown, not merely by the known relationship between the lan·
gnage of the Egyptian hieroglyphice, and the Coptic Macte
more recently spoken in that country, bnt still more strikingly
by the lact, that, although we have no doubt as to any of the
idioms spoken in ancient Britain, no on'e has been able as yet
to give a certain interpretation of the Rnnic inscriptions on the
pillar at Bewcastle and on the font at Bridekirk, which are both
in Cnmherland, and which both belong to the same dialect oi

· the low-German langnages‚ (see Palgrave, History of the Araplo-

sam, Lond. 1850, pp. 146 sq.). The really important point is
to deoermine the origin oi the ancient Etruscam and the Pern-
gian inscription, so far from throwing any difficulties irr the way
of the conclusion at which Ι have arrived, has furnished some of

the strongcst and most satisfactory confirmations of the Old
Norae affinity of the Rasena.

· ' This survey of the Etruscan language, brici and circumscribed
as it necessarily is, has enabled us to perceive that there is a
perfect harmony and agreement between the resulta of our lin-
guistic researches‚ so far as the scanty materiale have allowed
us to carry them, and the ethnographic and historic traditione
respecting the ancient Etruscans. We have scen that in the

and with Maelio in tha statue of the Aninyotora I hara no doubt that
Aulai is the genitive.
