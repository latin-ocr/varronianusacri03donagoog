Whatever may be thought of the verbal rescmblences be·
tween the Old Norse and the language of the Etruscan frag
ments, it must be admitted by ell sound philologers that we have
on indisputable proof of the affinity of these idioms iu the gram-
tnaticsl identity which I communicated to the British Assorin-
tion¹. Every reader oi the Runic inscriptions must have noticed
the constant occurrence of the auxiliary or mnsative verb lato =
facere in cocco esee, of which the Eddoe give ns the· forms ele
leet, lit, terit (see Egilsson‚ Len. Poet. Aret. Isirrq. Sept. p. 495).

i. e. “Ulfktil and Ku end Uni, they let raise astons in memory
of their father Ulf” (vide Dieterich‚ &maffredi-Sobora p.
372). Now we have here, as part of a constantly-recurring
phraseology, an auxiliary verb, signifying “to let” or “cause'f
followed by arr infinitive in -o. On reading the first line of the
longest Etruscan inscription, that of Perugia‚ we seem to stum-
ble et once upon this identical phraseology‚ for we find: eo lot
tanco ‘Eo Reeol amec oehr hoto Velthr’reoe. If we had no other
reason ior supposing that there was some connexion betweenthe
Seandinavians and Etruscans, we could not avoid being struck
by this apparent identity of construction. As, however, we have
