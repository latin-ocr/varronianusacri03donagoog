§fh Old Norae explanatione ofEtrurcuu proper aarum.

It has been shown in the preceding chapter that the con-
querors of the Umbrians and Tyrrheno-Pelasgians in Northern
Italy called themselves Rae-ena. Niebuhr has suggested that
this word contains the root rae- with the terminetion -ouo
found in Poro-ena, dee, and I have hinted that the same root
is found in the distinctive designation of this racc, Etrus-ci or
Eat-ruci, which presumas an original Her-rusi, whence Het-
rur·io for Bet-metir. The Old Norse will tell ns the meaning
both of the root and of the prefix, if I am justified in assuming
that the word was originally aspirated¹r for in Icelandic hetia
is “a warrior, hero, or soldier,'’ and in the same language roa
implies rapidity of motion, as at raca, “to run.’¹ So that liceum¹

² There is no authority for the aspiration of Etrruour and Etruria,
aa Manutius has remarhed Orthoyrapiio, a. r. Etruria: “ omnem aspira-
tionem omittunt veteres libri, lapides¹ et numi.” 1 therefore always cite
these words without the aspirato, aa this ia the authorized and fashion²
ahle orthography. But iu a foreign namo adopted by the Romana the
presumption is always in favour of a rough brenthing when the word
ὺεςίιιι with a vowel. In fact, theluniveraal tendency is rather to omit
than to introduce gratuitoualy the mark of an initial brcathing. The
following examples illustrate this tendency in Latin: azoto, Holoador
Alcyone, Haloyour orario, hur-enar arnapa, horuspear oper, κάπρως amodo,
toruntor amigo, hurrico,- edua, haderm· AEdui, Hoeduir oreo, hauto or
iubeor apulo ouo, ἁπαλὰ te, cf. epotare, ‘⁶ an egg-epoon ;” Annibal, ’Arri-
fler, Hannibal, Sym irc. lf the unaapirated formis genuine there
will be no difficulty in explaining the prefix either by reference to at,
tho prepositional preda, or at= ott, ‘⁴ stirpe, familia,'’ both of which are
used to form words in Old Norae (see the exemplet in Egilssou's Lacicou
Particum antiquo lineum Septrmrionotir, p. 27 equ). The word at-raani,
“odiam oecum' from at rauna is found quite in accordancs with
antrum from at roro. In au inscription from Tarquinii (Anu. deil'
lau. Arci. rr =1832p 151) we have the spelling tumultis, which ia
sprerumpsion in favour of an original aspirator for Halano is written
muria (Bou. Arete Sardo. 111. ³²3 ap. Fabretti, a n).
