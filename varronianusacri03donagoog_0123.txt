the original sixteen characters furnish only the sibilantes and

As these sibilante constitute the distinguishing ‘imbue in th'e
old Italian languages, it will be useful to speck more particularly
of them, before we turn to the other letters.

(a) The primery sibilant s, as used by the Umbrians and ·
Oscens, does not appear to have differed either in sound or ·
form, from its representative in the Greek alphabet.

(b) The secondary sibilant z, in the Umbrien end Etruscan
alphabets, appears to have corresponded to only one of the two
values of the Greek ζ. The latter, as I have proved elsewhere,
was not only the soft p or j, or ultimately the sound alc, but also,
in its original nse, equivalent to the combination ds, transposed
in some dialecto to ad, end ultimately assimilated to sa. Now
the Romans expressed the first sound of the Greek ζ, either by
di or by j, and its ultimate articulation (ah) by ως whereas, on
the other hand, they represented ζ-- dc either by a simple c²
or by ita Greek assimilation aa. Thus the Etruscan Kauana,
th, Kazc', Valtha, are written in Latin Goeaiua, Venetus,
Corsica ΙῙὶῑίεα, and Ζάκυνθος becomes Sapunto& while the
Greek μάζα, μύζω, ὄβρυζον, πντίζειν, ἇνωγκάζειν, κωμάζειν, may
he compared with macac, moroso, obessa, pytshaure, necesse, co·
mecauri. In the Eugubine Tables, words, which in the Umbrian
characters exhibit s z, give us a corresponding s in those which
are written with Latin letters. Thus, for the proper name
Iapcekom, as it iswritten in Umbrian charactera, we have in

the Latin letters Iobacslcc, Iahueker, dec.

(c) The aspirated Umbrian sibilant ε’, for which the Oscensi,
wrote x, expressed the sound eh (Germ. acl, Fr. cd), which was¹
