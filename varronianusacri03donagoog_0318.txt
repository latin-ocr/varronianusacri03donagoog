words hiemps (χείμων), habemas (χειμέρινος), ltt'o (χαίνω), humi
(χάμαι), hortere (χόρτος), dte. It represents the guttural c in
trah-o, war-si, veho, uec-si, dm. Iu a word, it corresponds to the

hard Senserit h, for which, iu the cognate Gothic and Greek ·

words, either 9, lr, or vy, κ, χ, are substituted (comp. N. Orat.
§ 112). Au initial Η, or some other guttural, was often omitted
in Latin as iu other laugusges before another consouaut3 thus
we have raa for hren = tra-tir for tir, “the hand;” rae for trra
or crus (karah=aro), tenu by the side of χλαῖνα, nidor by the
side of κνίσσα; Roma by the side of pruma (above, p. 68), dre.
And even before vowels we have frequent instances of extenua-
tiou aud omission of au original Η. Iudeed it is sometimes
a matter of doubt whether the Η ought to be retained or dismissed
in spelling; thus some would write Hannibal, others Aanrbal;
some Etruria, others, more correctly, as Ι think, but less in ac·
cordauoe with authority, Hetrurab5 although cat sud heard are
the samo word, aud though old MSS. make uo distinction
between them (Lachmann ad Lucrat. 111. 330, 632), the former
generally omits, while the latter as generally retains the Η, aud
, while haereo is almost the universally received orthography, we
have rasit in Lucret. VI. 1016 (uti a. Laeta), iu accordanee with
the Tyrrhenian almam, (above, Ch. v. § 3, p. 183).

With regard to Q or Q„ a character almost peculias to the
Latin alphabet, a longer investigatiou will be necessary. It has
been acommou opinion with philologers that there were different
classes of the tenuis 'guttural‚ varying with the vowel which
articulated them; thus, κάππα, koph, was0followed only by a,-
Η (hah) only by e ; χῖ only by i; κόππα, kopl, only by 0; aud
Qouly by a. Lepsius (Zwer' Ahhandl. pp. 18-31) has given a
more rational aud systematis form to this opinion, by supposiug
that there were three fundamental vowels, a, ι’, a,· that iwas
subsequently split up into τ’, a, and a into o, a,· that oue of the
three fundamental vowels was prefixed to each row of mutes in
the old orgauic syllabarium, so that all the medials were articu-
lated with a, all the aspiratos with ί, and all the tenues with a.

, This form of the opinion, however, is by uo means sufficient to

explain the peculiarities of the Roman og aud if it were, still
it could not be adopted, as it runs counter to the results of a
ruore scientific investigatiou into the origin of s‘aud a.
