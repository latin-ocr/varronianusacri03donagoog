ξ 7. The Numeral Signa.

This examination of the Latin alphabet will not be complete
without some remarks on the signs which were used by the
Romans to denote the numeral adjectires. Priscian, iu his
risnel school-bey way, has endeavoured to establish the connexion
between the numeral signs as we have them, and the ordinary
Roman capitals. Thus, quiaque, he tells us, is represented by
V, because this is the fifth vowel3 quinquaqinta is L, because,

etymologically, L and N may be interchanged, and N is πεντή- l
'‘⁰¹¹⁷“ 5¹¹ (1ῐοὶῖ quinqanriis D, because thiais the next letter Τ

to Cl-and so forth (Priscian, 11. p. 388, ed. Krehl).

Now there ean be no doubt that the Roman numeral signs 3
are derived from the Tuscana: though in certain cases a Roman ’

capital has been substituted for an Etruscan character which ᾖ
does not correspond to it in valae, and though in these instances ³

the figures are either inclined or reversed. The Etruscan cha·
raeters are as follows z-
I, ΙΙ, ΙΙΙ, IIII, Λ, AI, ΛΙΙ, ΛΙΠ, IX, X, dre.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10·
· XX, XXX, xxxxmrxp φ, φΧ,οω.
20, 30, 40,

50, 60,
Θ, 8,¹ b, ὠ, 1110.
100, 1000, 5000, 10000. ,

It is sufficiently obvious that the first ten of these characters
are identical with the Roman figures, the Λ, &a being reversed3
and as ‘ll is often written T, endas ὼ Ι, frequently occur on
Roman family coins, we may recognize in this character the
original of the Roman L, and therefore idcntify the Etruscan
and Roman ciphers from 1 to 99. The Roman C and the
Etruscan Θ do not appear to be connected; but the Etruscan 8,

or, as it is also written m, is clearly the same as the Roman οξ,
