is pronouuced a false reading and a mutileted representative of
Ταρασένα or Ταρσένα, which bears the earne relation to Τυρσηνός
that Porsena does to Hoporyvde οἳ nepesinae. There is an allus·
ing fecility about this emendation, but it is a shoclr to the most
credulous etymologist, when we prefixa syllable to one word
and decapitata another in order to bring them both to an agree·
ment with a third designation. In philology‚ as in other
depurhnents of humen science, we perceive resemblances before
we cau be persuaded that they are connected with irreconcilnbls
discrepancies. This we may see iu the identification of the
‘word Τνῤῥηνός with another neme peculias to the Etruscans of
Italy, which appears nuder the form Ταρχώνιον, Ihrlcyneh,
Tarpeebe'e'. It is perfectly consistent with sonnd philology to
say that Τυρσ- may be a sotter form of Ταρχ-, Tarte, or
Tarpa But, as I have elsewhere shown, if ταρχ-, or τραχ·
and τυρσ- belonged to the same root, the latter must be a
secondery or assibilated form of the other. Now to say nothing
of the fact that the σ- of rvpcpvdc and τύρ-σις belongs to the
termination, and is not found iu rip-arvos, Tip-vve, Θυρ-έα, Θύρ-
aeov, tire, itis clear that the form Τυρ-σηνός is the only oue
which was ever known to the Pelasgiaus in Graece, while the
harder form belongs to the later or mixed raee in Italy. They
must therefore be considered as different words. There is no
reason why the names Baretta =Itlteweia (ef. Apellea, Apellae),
Rem-ci, and Rae-ertu should not contain the same root: and
we shall see that there ere good grouffls for retaining these
words es the primitive and distinctiva designetion of a people ·
who invaded and'oonquered the mixed Tyrrhenians and Um-

brians of northern Italy.
