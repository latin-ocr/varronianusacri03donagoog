In orer ω munere the ancient mpemerny of ere ³

Atellam, we must beer ιιι mind the opposition which' rs always
recognized between them end the Mime. Hermann hns prc-
posed the following parallel clessificetion oi the Greek and
Roman plays (Opere v. p. 260, cf. Diomedes, 111. p, 480, Putsch):

GRAEGUM ARGUMEN'I'UM· ROMANUM decumum,

opaea (swelle ermen.
Paleou (appo). roqaetver earm vel saeer-

, Satyrion (σάτυροι). altem·
Mrem (μῖμος). Plant'per.

Adopting this clossification, which has et least much to recom-

mend it, wc shall see thetae the Greek satyricel ᾶιιιιιι was
theoriglnal formos the entertainment, and, though jocose, wes
not without its eleveting end religious clement, eo the Atel-
una, as a nationel drame, was immediately connected with
the festive worship of the people in which it took its rise, and

therefore retained a respectability which couldnot be conoedcd ι

tc the perlormonoes of foreign lemene. These wtiste were

not allowed to pollute¹ the domestic drame3 end, being free J
from ell conieci with the professional ector, the young Romen ι
could appear in the Atellan play without ιιι] forfeiture of his l
