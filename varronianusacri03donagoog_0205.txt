destiny of Μελέαγρος (Motho) by driving in e neil; though it
isclesr from tho wings thet the neme only ie Greek, while the
figure ol the deityis genuine Etruscan (Melior, Etr-mh. 11.
p. 331). From these consideratione it seems esaie inference
that Nortia, or Nereia, is simply moria, tte-vertia, the ''A-rpo-
πος, or “unturning, unchmging goddees‚'’ according to the
consistent analogy of memnonem, prioremque-versus,
ἱπενονεεωείηενψυενηω, proroum, prorsum, or prosum (in prosa
matth) = preversum, remmath-eorsum, &cr end this supposi-
tion receives additional confirmation from the stetement men-
tioned below (ξ 3), that eornm was actually o Tuscan word.

The god Merqmoim appears on the Tuscae monuments es
llcrme = Thmoo. This Etruscan neme hos been well explained
by the Jesuit G. P. Secchi (Annali dell' Irmtc'toto, vm. pp. 94
sqq.). It appears thot Lycophron‚ who elsewhere uses genuine
Italian nomes of deities end heroes (es Μάμερτος for Ἄρης, vv. ’

Now Thmoo certainly does not differ more from this Tepptelc
then Euterpe end thle from their Greek representatives (Bnn-
een‚ ibid. p. 175). It might seem, then, thet Termes is not the
Latin Terminus, but rather the Greek ‘Eproiw for the Hellenic
respirate being represented in the Pelasgian lenguege‚ according
to mle, by the sibilent, this might pass into Τ, es in ἡμέρα,

The nome Lar, Lao, when it significs “ lord ’¹ or “ noble‚''

has the addition of o pronominal affin ·t; when it signifies “ god,’'
it is the simple root: the former is Loro (Barth), gen. Larte} ,-
the letter Lar, gen. Laris. Precisely the same difference is
observable in e comperison between Ἄνακες, Ἀνακοι, “the
Dioscuri‚'‘ and ἅνακ-τες, “linge‘’ or “ noble5.’' Similerly the
