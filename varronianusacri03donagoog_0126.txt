Thelctters Laud uwere of rare occurrence in the Umbriau
language. The former never stands at the beginning of a word,
the latter never at the end of one. In the Oscan languege we
meet with L more frequently.

As the Etruscan alphabet had no medule, those of the Engu-
bine Tables which are written in Etruscan characters substitute
x for u, ag. Krapcoa' for Grabova But the Oscan and Um·
brian inscriptions when written in Latin characters distinguish
between the tenuis and mediol gutturals, according to the marks
introduced by Sp. Carvilius, viz. c, o.

In the Oscan alphabet n is represented as a reversed u3
and the affinity between these letters in the Latin languagc is
well known.

The labial Ρ, which never terminates aword in Latin, stands
at the end of many mutilated sonus both in Umbrian and Oscau,
as in the Umbrian oitlup sor attolebat (arelo), and the Oscan
nep for aeque. In general, it is to be remarked that the letters
Ρ, r, n, s, n, and u, all occur as terminatione of Umbrian or
Oscan words.

. The grammatical forms of the Umbriae language arc very
instructive. In Umbrian we sec the secondary letter r, that im·
portant clement in the formation of Latin words, not only regu-
larly used in the sonnation of the ceses and numbers of nouus ·
which in Latin retain their original a, but also appearing in
plural verb-forms hythe side of the primitive a, which is retained
in the singular, though the Latin has substituted the r in both

numbers. The following are the three declensions of Umbrian
nouus, according to the scheme given by Aulrecht and Kirchhoff
(Umbr. Sprccldenlrm. pp. 115 sqq.; ¹see also Mttller, Gottt'np.
