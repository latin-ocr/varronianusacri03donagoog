Tages, the dwarf, who rose from the ground at Tarquinii aud
conveyed to the Etruscam their knowledge of divination, is one
of the wonderful little men, who appear in the Old Norae stories¹.
The duodenary system of the Etruscam reappears in theold
Saxon or Gothic fo'rm of goremmeut'. The most striking in-
stance, however, of the Teutonic peculiarities of the ancient
Etruscam is furnished hythe correspondence between the Tus·
can combat of gladiatore and the Helm-priapo, i. e. the duel or
monomachy of the scandinaviam. It is generally admitted
that the gladiatorial exhibitione at Rome originated in Etruria⁸,
and that they belonged at first to the funeral solemnities of the
country. Indeed there is no representation 'more common on the
better class of Etruscan 'monuments than that of the gladiatorial
comhat round the altar sacred to the tomb of tha deceased3 and
wc must refer to this class everi the group supposed to represent
Echetlus at the battle of Marathon, which is of frequent occur·
rencs, and which appears to me to be only a particular modi·
fication of a cofitest analogous to that of the rausa. The
custom of -sacrifi'cing prisone'rs of war at the tomb of a deputed
warrior ia connected with the traditione of the Trojan war.
Such a sacrifice takes place at thefuneral of Patroclus⁴, and
Achilles himself 'is appensed hythe sacrifice of the Trojau
⁴ princess Polyxena⁸. The ancient Greeks, like the ancient Etrus-
cans, were mixed up with Pelasgians, and both natione were
thus placed in the c'hannel of direct communication with the
Phoenicians, who influeuced the religion and usages of all the
Pelasgian tribes. Now we know that the funeral sacrifices of
the old Italians had reference to the worship of Kronou or
Summas, the subterraneons God, who fed on his own children3

and the gladiatorial gemes were especially exhibited at the
Saturnalia. On a tontb copi‘ed by Bonarota (Dempeter, Vol. 111.
