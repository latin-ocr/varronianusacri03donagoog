Before the Italian lengnage revived as a vehiele ol literary Ι
communication, the peninsula had been subjected to a series of
invasione, which had modilied and corrupted in no slight degree
the speech of the country people. This was affected not only by
the influence ol the conquerere, but also by the inlusion oi a con·
siderable amount of foreign population. In Lombardy and other
parts, where the invaders formed a permanent settlement, the
change was most sensibly and durably felt3 whereas Tuseany,
whichhad been screened by its position from any permanent or
extensive occupation by the northern tribes, was not exposed to
this corruption ol its familiar language, andita greater wealth,
its commemo, and its i'ndepeudence, preserved among its inha-
bitants a residuum of the old Latin literature and eivilisation.

When, therefore, vernacular composition revived in Italy,
it was emphatieally Tnsean. It is true that the new literary
language spread itsclf over the whole ol Italy, and that there
were varieties of secent in the different districte¹. Still, how-
ever, a purity of Tuscan phraseology ie essential to literary oor·
rectnessc and whatever a man's native accent may be, he must
accommodate it to this court-language, It follows, therefore,
that the pronunciation elmodam Italian must be syllabic. In
other words, it must be more alrin to the studied aecnracy with
which the Romans of the Augustae age pronounced their Grae·
cized' poetry, than to the natural articulation of the ancient
Italians. It has been truly said, that the Italian language can·
not be prononnced both well and quickly. This is only another
expression of the fact, thot a literary language, which is not
natural, can only be articulatcd syllabically. The qualification

same fact; for here we have a· recognitiones the truth, that the
modern Italian is a written language to be prononnoed according
