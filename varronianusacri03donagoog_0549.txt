may conclude that it was prouounced as a single long syllable.
Festus tells us that there was a form facul, and facila appears as
a mere aremari in the Scipio epitaph (c. 5); above, ch. vl.
ξ 20. Perhaps the most singular instance of this omission of the .

guttural is fumished by the French fus'bla from,fla:ribilsir,· for in
this there is a double collapsa.

The imperatives ati, redi, are monosyllables with the omis-
sion of the nnnecessary d and d (Adelph. 11. 1, 13, and 36),
and jaba throws off its ὀ (Adrisit. v. 6, 1), as it does in the
perfect, dio.

The phrase hono anina es is shortened for the same reason as ,
the other imperatives. In Plautus (Rudans, 111. 3, 17) it forms
a cretio:

‘o muca maa spa aas a ssa-m a.

We observo the same sort of abbreviation in a number of
· nouns of common occurrence3 such, for instance, as express the
nearest degrees of family relationship. The compound pomaria
indicatas a contraction of pater analcgous to the Freneh pera,
and the word was probably so pronounced in such lines as

(raupa 1. 1,51):

Hoc pour ae minus inurat: lace pas· sequier lo.
Hoc ptrs cardonam {mutate lico qut mus.

ana (rapa. 1. r, aas

Natura willipato· ss, masiliis apos La.
Natam to pli pers ιι, οὑπείρὶίε spo.

where the ictus falls upon it. In the latter line, as tu is em-
phatic, an elision would be inadmissible3 we must therefore pro· ⁴

'nounoe illi either as the Italian pli or as the French lut, and ·

this gives us another modern analogy. In the former line dmut-
πω is probablya dissyllable following the analogy of dominc,
which becomes donno iu Italian, aud donas in French. Similarly,
laninas is a monosyllable in the passage quoted above from the
Phormio ,· animus becomes ama· fiscina, femme, &c

That puer was often a monosyllabis appears from the forms
por, pora, which occur in inscriptions, from the compounds Luci·
por, Marcipor, dre, and from the Spartan ποῖρ for arcis. In
Heaut. v. 5, 16, we should read or pronounce as follows:

onae m'yf pol tf do pollam [cr pastam] lepidam purim tu soil amba.
