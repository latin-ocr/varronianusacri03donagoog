a servant, butte the gracions help of Abora-moade, “the lord

of light,” and his celestial steed-thc Suu. In India also the ι

same figure was adopted, and there may be uacca of itin the
Greek myth of Kephalos, the belcved of Eos. ‘⁸ Kephalos,” says

Max Muller (ch. Ειο. 1856, p. 53), “was the rising Sun-the
head of light-an expression frequently used of the Sun in
different mythologice. In the Vade, where the Sun is addressed
as a horse, the head of the horse is an expression meaning the
rising Sun.”

Another compound, which may with equel facility he referred
to the Indo-Germanic family of languages, is the name by which
the Scythians designated the Amazona. Οἰόρπατα, according to
Herodotus, is equivalent to ἀνδροκτόνος-οἰὸρ «γὰρ καλέουσι
rdv ἄνδρα, τὸ δὲ ποτά, κτείνειν. Now οἰόρ is clearly the
Senserit otro, the Zend coiryo, ntro (Barnous, chnc, p. 236),
the Latin cir, Gothic coir-s, Welsh gwyr, and the Lithuaniau
cyrae. The root pot in Senserit does not signify primarily “to ’
kill,” bnt “ to fall;’' though the munative form ρᾶιαραιι· constently
means “ he kills;’' “ie. “causes to fall.'' It seems more pro·
bable, however, that the Scythian articulation has substituted a
tenuis for the ascend, as in tha case of ιροιρα for roorqo, men·
tioned above, and that the verb is to he sought in the common
Senserit root vada, “te atrike,’' “to kill,” “to desnoy,‘⁴ Irish
fhetkeim, “I kill.’'

Pliny (Bne. Nat. vr. 17) tells us that the Scythian name
fer Monnt Caucasus was Graneesh, ie. nive condidus. The
first part of this word is clearly connected with gela, glorias,
κρύος, xpri-orcum, kalt, eold, ρναο, and gray ,· and ench,
“white,” may be compared with σοι-ιιι, cernor (senex Orco·

In the tract about rivers, printed among Plutarch's Frag-
ments, we have the following Scythiau words, with iuterpreta-
tions annexed. He does not translate ἅλίνδα, which hs describes
as a sort of cabbage growing near the Tanais (c. xlv. ξ 2): we ¹
may compare the word with Ternarunde: He tells us, however,
that βριξάβα means ιιριοῧ μέτωπον (c. xtv. § 4), that φρύξο
