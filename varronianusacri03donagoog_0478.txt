passage (Hom. It. x. 419) aud as the context shows (cf. Il.
v11.371; xvnr. 299) that the true reading is: -

ἀλλήλοις,

the portentous dyppydpdact should be expunged from all dic·
tionaries and grammars. The 2nd pers. plur. ἐγρήγορθε, and
the infin. ἐγρήγορθαι are easily justifiable. But to return to
the Latin verbs in ·t‘, while we ohserve an obstinate retention
of the characteristica in all other inflectione, we not unfro-
quently find that the perfect and its participle (E. ΙΙΙ.) are
formed as from the nahed root. Thus from amic-io we have
¹ alwici, amab-tua, from aper-io, aper-ui, aper-tus, from haur-io,
dau-ai, baua-tna, from centio, sert-ei, sea-saa, from cen-io,
ven-i, oea-tua. In all these cases we may conclude that the
sense of completion borne by the perfect has enabled it to die
pense with the elongating appendage of the present and its sub-
ordinate forms.

A. Mate Verba

Mate verbs, whether their characteristic be labial, guttural,
or dental‚ do not exhibit any peculiarities' of inflexion which call
fordetailedexamination. The perfect is generally either the redu-
plicative form (a) or the aorist in -si,· the reduplication is some-
times represented merely by lengthening the root-syllable, as iu
samo, scobi, ltyo, ῑξᾳίς sometimes the first syllable is omitted
without compensation‚ as in ftdi, sctdi,· and this is always the
case in compomrds, as cado, cectds‘, but macida, concidi. Boo,
which is reduplicated in the present, canhare no further redu·
plication in its perfect, which is accordingly tati. The few verbs
which have an agglutinate perfect in -J‘ia' must have borrowed this
lost form of the vowel-conjugation. We are able to justify
this surmise by comparing cando} catat with crebo. And of
course the same explanation must apply to strepa, -r‘s, strepi&
compared with'orepa -oa, crepui, frendo, -a's, frendat, compared
with strideo, &c The verbs peto and rudo, which form their
perfect and its participle as from a verb in -r',-namely, pettas',
Μίνως rudivi, raditw—are shown by this fact alone to be
