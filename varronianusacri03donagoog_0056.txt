a contest between the orruerit (κούρητες)2 “men of the our-rb,

and wielders of the spear, or'wearers of the helmet‚” and the ’

Horatii (χερνῆτες), “handicraftsmen,'’ ic. the lower order, in
which contest, as usual, the latter succeeded in maintaining their
just rights. In the old tradition it is uncertain which of the
two fought for Alba (Liv. Ι. 24), aie. whether the Latin or
Sabine interest was at that time predominant at Rome. The
¹story about Horatius Cocles admits of a similar interpretation.
The Tuscans were repelled at the bridgehesd by the three
Roman tribes—Lartius (Lartis, Lora, “prime” or “king”) re·
presenting the head-tribe, Herminius the second, and Hecateia
the third. The sumame Cocles still further explains the name
Horatius in its opposition to Curiatius. The ancients knew
that this word meant one-eyed (Plin. H. N. xxxvn. 55), and I
have elsewhere suggested that it may be derived from coeculae
(N. Orat. ὅ 154). 'l'he last part is undoubtedly that derivative
from ire, which is found in mil-iter, ped-it-ea, eqo-itm, &c
With the Romans, as with other natione, the ideas of being and
,poreq are interchangeable (N. Orac. §269), ond therefore we
should not press the meaning of this termination further thau
by saying that coclea is a form analogous to miles, &c Now
the other term for one-eycd is looccw, which is to be compared
with λοξός, hafter. This last word, as the name of the archer·
god, Apollo, refers unquestionably to tho oblique or eide-long
position of the bowman in the aot of shooting3 and there is
no reason why the same explanation should not apply to the ·
coelites, who will thus represent the ψιλοί or light-mmcd troops
of the commenalty. As in the ease of David and Goliam,
the triumphis greater when there is au inequality in the arms3
and this no doubt was felt to enhance the Horatian victory and
the successful defencc of the Pone Subliciaa. Considered as
an army, the Romam fell into the following subdivisione-the
populus or patriciae ὁπλῖται, the celeraret plebeian knights,
and the plebe, i.e. πλῆθος, or multitado, who were the milites,
properly so called, “the common soldiers who marched in a
body‚” and who were by virtue of their armour merely coclites,
or “shooters.” And thus the moqahter populi and mephres
equitem, or urbanae celerum, will stand in a military opposition
to the trahant plebis. The separation between the popalus and
