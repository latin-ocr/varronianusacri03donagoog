Accordingly, we lind that the most primitive specimens of
Latinity may now-adays be understood by the scholar, who,
after all, possessas greater advantages than Polybius and his con-
temporary Romans. This will appear if we examine tbe song
of the Fratres Arvales, which isone of the most important and
ancient specimens of the genuine Roman language. The inscrip-
tion, in which it is preserved, and which was discovered in the
year 1777, is probably not older than au. 2183 but there is
every reason to believe that the cantilena itself was the same
which was sung in the earliest ages of Rome-dor these litanias

6. Priumpe, triumpe, mampa biwnpa, triumpe.

There can be little doubt as to the meaning of any single
word in this old hymn, which seems to bs written in very rude
