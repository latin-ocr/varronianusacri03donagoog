β 1. General Definitahaa.

THE term pronoen, in accordance with rts original meaning
(,pronomca deamata,- )ought to denote only those words
which are used as substitutos for nonna. But according to that
which appears to meto he the only scientific classification, all
words fall into two great divisiones-promum, or words which
indicate space or position ; and worda ooatoim‘ny rocta, which
express the positional relations of general attributes. The former
do not allow any admixture with the other clement of langnage:
the latter require the addition of at least one pronominal suffia
to make them words. I have therefore proposed¹ to call the
praecanam poeitimaol worda, the organizing, constituent, or
formative clement of inflected langmge, and the roca I would
designate aa the material clementes human speech. With thia
extension of meaning the term prouoco will include not only the
personal, demonstrative, and relative words, which it generally
denotas, bnt also the prepositions, the conjunctione, and those
adverbs which are not merely cases of nouns.

β 2. Peraoool Proaoana.

Althongh the verb hae three persons, the Latin language
does not use more than two personal pronouns or general indi-
catione of the nominative case. For, although ayo and ta may be
used with the first and second persons of the verb, which, as we
shall see, are not consistently expressed hythe inflexione, with
the third person, which always ende in -t or dur, the nominative
is either omitted or expressed hy a noun substantive. When,
however, in the objectiva construction it is necessary to introduce
