another form of mantas,· for this was an image “moanis malis
aa late datam et ingentem dentibus sonitant faciens” (Fest.
p. 128). The two words may be connected with man-dere,
asadada, the n, which is necessary in nassamones, being here
only euphonical: similarly, we have masadan edacem a man-
dendo scilicet (Fest. p. 139), and naen-tam hythe sida os parias
(ε γνάθοι, Hesyeh.) Compare also mala, manith, dac. Itis
hot improbable that the Greek, or perhaps Pelasgia, μάντις eon-
tains this root. The mysterious art of divination was connected,
in one at least of its branches, with the rites of the infernal
gods. Teiresr'as, the blind prophet, wat especially the prophet

of the dark regions. Now Mantua, according to Virgil, was -

founded by Ocnus, “the bird oi omen,” who was the son of
Manto, and through herthe grandson of Teiresr'as. This at
least is legendary evidence of a connexion between mantas and
μάντις. The same root is contained in the mythical mandras
(Mttller, Etraslr. lt. p. 96).

Tuscan name Anaorr'a may be explained by acomparison of

According to Servius, Oeres, Pales, and Fortuna, were the
three Penates oi the Etruscana (see Micali, Storna, 11. p. 117).

in Etruria, and especially at Volsinii, where she bore the name
Nortia, Neratii, or Nursia, and was the goddess of the calendar
or year (Cincius, ap. La‘o. vll. 3). The nails, by which the
calendar was marked there, pointcd to the fixed and unalterable
characteres the decrees of late. The Fortuna of Antium had
the uail as her attribute, and the edrai nabahs and other imple-
ments for fastening marked her partner Necessitas (Hor. 1.
Carne. xxxv. 17 sqq.); under the Greek name of Ἀτροπος
(Athrpa) she is represented on a Tusoan patera as fixing the

those of Geryoneae in the isle of Erythia, and (p. 363) 'we mest tham in
the undar-world ander the care of the same herdsman. This looks vary
like two differant forms of the same legend3 the hero in t'hs one secking
tha aboda of Hades in tha west, in the other in tha under-world. The
name Geryoneae might comsapond in signification with motta and κλῦ·
μενος, epitheta of Hades.” .
