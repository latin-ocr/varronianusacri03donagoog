It will be ohserved, that in these interesting monuments we
have both that camedrals, or dropping of the final m, which led
to ecthlipsis (e. g. duoncro’ for honorans), and also the visarpa, or
evanescencs of the nominative s(as in Cornelio for Cornelius).
The diphthong ai is not always changed into aa, and yantas iras
not lost its initial p. We may remark, too, that n seems not to
have been pronounced before s: thus we have cosol, coeor, for
anmi, osmer, according to the practice of writing cos. for consul
(Diomed. p. 428, Putseh). Epitaph (a) has Xuti· sl. Judt'lc„ i. e.
decemvir alitibus jndilcnada's, where we not only observe the ini·
tial a of s[t]lalt]s =streit„but also tbe lc before a in judicanda.
The phraseology, however, does not differ in any important par-
ticulare from the Latin language with which we are familiar.

The metre, in which the three oldest of these inscriptions are
composed, is deserving of notice. That they are written in
Saturnian verse has long been perceived; Niebuhr, indeed, thinks
that they “are nothing else than either complete nenias, or the
beginnings of them’' (H. R. 1. p. 253). It is not, however, so
generally agreed howywe ought to read and divide the verses.
For instance, Niebuhr maintaius that patre, in a. 2, is “beyond
doubt an interpolation3 ” to me it appears necessary to the verset
He thinks that there is no ecthlipsis'in apt'ce’, c. 13 I cannot
scan the line without it. These are only samples of the many
differences of opinion, which might ariae upon these short inscrip-
tions: it will therefore, perhaps, be desirable, that a few general
remarks should be made on the Saturnian rnetrc itself, and
that these remarks should be applied to the epitaphs before us,
which may be placed among the oldest Latin specimens of the
Satnmian layl.

¹1dvy's transcript of the inscription of T. Quinctius is confessediy
impertae„ the historian says: “bis senne ineisa littoris fuit” (vr. 29).
