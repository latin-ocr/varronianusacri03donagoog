§el rur amru courucrmous. 469

for :usu or tultus, from the root of tolla tolyo, or thro. No
difficulty is suggested by an immediate comparison of fer-o with
the Greek depo, Sanscr. burt, Ο. Η. G. har, Engl. “bear''
But even without comparative philology it has been seen that
fer-o must be connected with fer-:b and finum thus Mtiller
support! his reading, dffensrts, in Festus, p. 272 (Suppl. Anaot.
p. 401, above, p. 245), by referring to the use of <fienda defende,

infensus, infestus, confestim, “quibus illud ostenditur synony- ¹

mum fuisse serrendo et trudendo,'’ and he adds, “quod poste-
riorum temporum usu diceretur: eam oh caussam dies differetur:
majore cum vi, nec sine emphasi quadam sic pronunciabatur:
no nrrs nrrruusus nsro.” But if dr'Jy‘eudo: defero, of course
,yhrrdo :scre With regsrd to the adjectives infictae and τή-
festus, which are so often confused, while ‹rffem from <fienda
shows that the former is connected with irs-fendo, a comparison
of manifestas, fest-ino, proves that irs-fiscus is the old end
genuine participle of infero. The meaning of these apparently
synonymous words is quite in accordance with this etymology;
for while infensus denotes an unfriendlyor angry disposition of
the mind, and so corresponds tc iratas, inimicae, on the other
hand, infectus always signifies some outwerd opposition or attack,
so that it ansvers to docem, hostiles. Hence wc find in the
same passage of Livy (11. 6) : “ concitat calcaribus equum, atque
in ipsum infestus consulem dirigit.. ..adeoque infensos animis
concurrerunt, nt . . . . duabus haerentes hastis moribundi ex equis
lapsi sint,” where the “ infensas animis’' implies the aninwes'ty
with which they were actuated3 and the infestus the direct
charge full tilt against the adversary; as in the parallel descrip-
tion of the fight between the two brothers in Sophocles (Antip.
145) they are described not only as orvyepol, but also as καθ’
αὑτοῖν δικρατεῖς λόγχας στήσαντε. Η we admit the affinity of
ferio and fero, we shall see at once that the former, which is the
secondary form, merely exhibite the adjunct μα, and the idea of
striking is intimately connected with that of lifting, bearing,
carrying: for a blow is nothing more than e weight or momen·
tum brought to bear on some object: hence, the earliest wcapon
of offence is naturally termed a ῥόπαλον hom ῥὲπω, just as
the instrument of protection is called ὅπλον srom 's'rru (New

oras. 5259). The connexion between sendo end fero is not 'so
