which has always appeared to me to open the way to a chain
of the most interesting associatione.

It has been shown elsewhere (N. (1111116) how the
Greek 11, originally the mark 01 aspiration, eume to be used as
a sign foi the long a. 0ut 01 that investigation it appeared—
(1) that a short vowel aspirated may be equivalent to an nn·
aspirated long vowel; (2) that the vocalized consonante iand a
may change their plaee; (3) that these vocaliaed consonante may
be absorbed into or represented by the long vowel only. Το
the instantes given there, Ι will now add the iota subscriptum

have an adjective ἥμερος, “civilizedss' “cultivated,'’ duc. the
regular antithesis 01 lippam and it has been suggested (ibid.
§150), that this word was originally applied to a country
through which there was a road or passage, 0 country divided
by a read (διάμερος); just as ἄγριος was properly applied 10 a
rude, open country, with nothing but ἅγροιθ. This is sufficiently
proved by AEseh. Eunoen 13, 14: κελευθόττοωι παῖδες Ἡφαίσ-
