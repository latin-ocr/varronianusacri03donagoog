s word ss pars (in the passage quoted above from Plautus), and l
hythe sideofomaium, es in Cic. Ost. 1. 7: patrio est oom- ¹
munes omnium nostrum pareas, “ our native land is the common

pment of all of us,'’ many end separabls as we are. But that it

is really in this case un attraction from the inflected possessive,
is clear from such passages as Cic. Cot1v. 2: ti ud mtrurn
omnium coedem Borma emiserant. We have u genitive hythe
side of the possessive in the construction of the impersonal verbs,
s or rather phrases, refert=rei fert, “it contributus to the in-
* ³ fri terest,’' end Ᾰηῳνᾳεε, “it is concerned about the business,'’
‘⁴ where rei is understood in the sense in which the Latin verb
has become an English substantive. In these phrases we hare
cithera gen. of the person or persons interested‚ or the pos-
sessive pronouns, meo, tud, aad, nostro, amad, sgreeing with
the dative rei, expressed in refert, and understood in throne.
Thus we heve: faciundum aliquid, quod illorum meyri, wem
oua retulisse vederetur, “he must do something which might
seem to have been more for the interest of those others then
for his own;'' emarescere solebat non tom sud quom respub·
lico interesoe, ut calcus essu, “ Cesar used to sey thet it uss
not so much for his interest ns for that of the state that he
should be safe.‘’ That ra for rai is the dative, end consequently
thet oren, sud, dac, here stand for mese, snoe, dec, is proved
hythe competent testimony of Verrius (Festus, p. 282, ed.
Muller): refert quum Meus, morenos ait Verrius. Esse
entire rectam REI seles, dutim scilieet, aon ablativo cusu. In
(lato, R. R. c. 3. we have: et rei et virtuti et plor-ria orit.
Thac fero may be used absolutely without any accusative is
clear from such phrases asr dum tempus od eam rem tulit
(Ter. Andr. 1.2, 17), dum otas tulit (id. ibid 11. 6, 12), suno
itu tempus fert, ut cupium (Heaut. lv. 1, 54), sedicet s'tc tempus
fert (Adelph. v. ἓν, 5). And it is unnecessmy to show thutfero,
like λυσιτελέω, may govern the dminus oooemodi. The change
of ω into o is found also in poet-hoc, inter-es, dc, which will
be explained immediately.

lFor re= rei iu this sense cf. Plsut. Mannum. 111. 2, 9= 68⁵: tna
rc umatus caspio.
