Greek Ἀρ-τεμι[δ]ς, 1s instructive. We might suppose from this
that Ari-timi·e, the “virgin of the see,” end Ἀρέ-θουσιι, “the

virgin ewistly flowing,'’ were different types osone end the seme
goddess (see above, pp. 45, 59). Ἀρτεμής appears to me to be
a derivative from Ἄρτεμις. The next words probably oontsin
the nume and description of the person who mede the offering.
The name seems to hove been Fauen Rspiunt'a or Rapite.
Lnnzi ond lliiller recognize a verb in turco, which is of frequent
occurrence. on the Etruscan monuments, und translate it by
ἐποίει, dedit, ἀνέθηκε, or the like. Lanzi goes so fer es to

melre a verb ol n, were it not lor the contextl. Its position,
however, between the proper name und the word cleo, whioh' m

ceco (probably a reduplication, like pepe on the Todi statue:
compare otiu-cle modove in the Peruginn inscription, end oeebuse
on the Bomarzo sarcophagus, Dennis, 1. p. 313), and to suppose

Lo . Fenete La . Letbial ctera
Se . Fonete Lo . tertiat don:

ond again:
derce oleouroi.
The order of the words seems to show that ctera menno “the

elder’' and olen “the younger3‘’ but if unwano, we should
infer that olon must mean the first or leod ol the family².
