causes not unlike those which ultimately affected the Latin,
exhibita some of tha characteristica, which distinguish the
modern idioms of Italy, France and Spain. In Umbrian, as in
these languages, we see the substitution of -o for the termination
am, so that fato is both the old Umbrian and modern Italian
forficem,- in Umbrian, as· in the modern Romanoa langnages,
the final a and d are constantly dropt; in this old form of native
Italian no less than in its most modern descendants, we observa
