sumes a taking, ancl the outstretehed hand is the sign of hoth”
(see Pott, manet. p. 272). li this is the true explanation of
the root when it occurs as a verb, we may reasonably apply the
saun interpretation te its use as a noun. In this ir appears
under all the different forms thone, maath, thorno, taath·
- ίαπηία, dona, and tho (Melle, Etruria 11. 303, 315). From
the collocation it isclear that the word ie equivalent to petra,
or rather it significa “ an offcring” generally, without the impli-
cation of a vorr or prayer. Thus, while trahere in the only urn

such phrases aa duplicet undena od sidero palmeo with pom'gr’t

the Latin langnage comes sufficiently near thc language of this

emm tendit (vel porrigit) Nefaria, as we heve any right to
expect. The Perugian inscription, however, ia even nearer to
the Runic than this patera legend is to the Latinr and the cri·

conclusive in proof of the effinity between the Etruscan end Old
Norse lauguages. Aa loatn and hamele occur together on
another Etruscan sepulchre, thera can be no objection to connect
