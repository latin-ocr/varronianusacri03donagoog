ordinary meaning of Iolen or kleiac. And thus whether the
Etruscan olea significa “young'’ generally, or simply “the
child” in particular, in contrast with the parents, the Icelandic
will help the explanation. This result is supported, not only, as
I have already mentioned, by the order in which ctera aud olea
appear, but also hythe occurrence of ocu iu conjunction with
the adjunct er or cra, which, iithere is any truth in the Scaudi-
navian hypothesis, must be compared with the Old Norae oere' or
eri, “junior’' (Egilsson, Lmicoa, p. 131). Iu the Perugisn in·
scription (1.6) we have arci perat, which may he the genitive
cases cf a substantive and adjective denoting “younger child”

(compare pero with the root hor, and the words baro, ὀανη,
“hairu” tm). And that clau means “son” in particular rests

to a certain extent on positive evidence. For the only bilin-
gual inscription, in which 1 have found clane, mmo to imply
that, unless otherwise expressed‚ this word merely deuotes son·

thre 0. clama F, the cognomen &amicus being an
addition in the Latin version. This view is confirmed by the fact
that cim sometimes occurs in the same inscription with the
matronymic iu -ol, as in the inscription quoted above; und while
in the bilingunl inscriptions this matronymic is rendered by
notua, olona, es we have seen, is translated filisa and sometimes
filius is added without any corresponding cion in the Etruscan
inscriptions. The following examples will show all the different
ussgcs oi this adjunct:

patronymic.
