Thus Terence has (Andr. 11. 1,10): “ tu si tio sis, aliter sentias,’' '
“if you were fn my place, you would think otherwisc.'’ In
lawsuits abta, “the meu before you,‘’ i. e. the judices, is the ’

opponente hence, we find this pronoun used with a certain ex·
pressior of contempt to indicate a person who hes been brought
unfavourably before the notice of those whom we are addressing5
whereas ille, “thet other‚'’ as indicating a person so striking as
to sttract our attention in spite of his remoteness‚ is osten used
to denote a well-known or eminent individ uel, as: “ magnus tlt
Alexander‚'‘ or ‘⁴ Medos clla? In all these usages the triad hic,
ote, ille, correspond to the Greek dhe, οὗτος, ἐκεῖνος. This is
especially seen in the employment of ’ὁδε and οὗτος to designate
the first end second persons respectirely. Thus OEdipus is made
to say of himself: otu μὴ λάχωσι τοῦδε συμμάχου (OEd. 0.
450): but heis addressed by the subterraneous voice (ibid.
1627): oi οὗτος, οὗτος Οἰδίπους, τί μέλλομεν ; The speaker
in a lew-court generally designatos himself, his client, and his
affairs, by bde3 but the opponent is orirer = oo, “the man before
you” (the judges). In continuone narrative τάδε arethe things
which Ι am about to say, which are before mc, but not yet

· before my readers ; whereas ταῦτα are the things just said, and

which hare boen submitted to them. This shows that the true
reading in AEschylus, Sappl. 313, must be:

XO. Βῆλον δίπαιδα παι-ἔρα τοῦδ’ ε’μοῦ wurpdr.

ΒΑ. τὸ πᾶν sudor rur ὄνομα τούτου μοι φράσω.
For the Chorus having spoken of their father as present by
them (τοῦδε), the King, in his reply, would designate him as by ἕ
their side (τούτου). g

With regard 'to the etymology of the indicative pronouns‚

there can be no doubt that the first pert of lsi-c corresponds to 3
the Greek ἴ, which appears as the nominative of the reflexive

ἔοεοῦ, oi, ἔ. It is therefore a subsidiary form of ὁ-- σο, 'aad
while the t is represented by a more originalsibilant in arf-c, ee,
tre, ithae vanished altogether in i-a, f-tercm, item, dte. The
most original form represented the Acloat es a strong combina-
tion of the guttural and lsbial, which we cell the digamma3 and
thus qui, sic, tic, is, will be four forms of the sume pronominsl
root signifying proximity, in which the guttural clement hes
successively degenerated. The sibilent form, which is regularly
