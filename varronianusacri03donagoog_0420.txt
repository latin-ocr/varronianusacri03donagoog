ablative and ἐν with the dative express the simplest and meet
elementary ucticn of locality-the being e'u a place. With
the accusative, e’a signifies into or autc a place, deriving the
expression of motion from the case with which it is connected.
When ἐν is connected with the accusative in this sense, itis
always expanded to εἰςεένς, except in some of the lyric pects,

⁶ · such as Pinder, who, like the Romane, use ἐν to express both

locetion with the dative and motion with the accusative. There
isne doubt that ἐν, εἰν, ciat, dud, ἵνα, are ultimately identicah
the original form having been fava, which expresses motion
through the nearer tc the more distent object. Praetieally, ia
represents all the uses of ἐν, elected, and even of the negative

· pretix which corresponds te the lest. Thus we have ἀνὰ με’-

,remia-veen, ἐν τῇ atamen urbe, sic τὴν wokev--ia retent
ἆν-ήριθμος = imeameraa. While ia thus correspouds tc some
of the applicatione of dud, the other meanings of the Greek
particle are represented hythe inseparable prelix re· or red,

which, like the Greek ῥα, is ultimately traceable tc au κ

identity with va· (Nero Orat. ἓξ see-270). This prefix,
which properly signifies “up ” as the correlative of “down'’
is very osten used, like dud, tc give to a compound tbe converse
meaning to that which is borne by the simple verb. The
origin of this is to be sought in the opposition of eve to eard.
Thus if meantem means “ to cover down,” or “put down
a covering,’' ἀνακαλύπτω would mean “to up-cover‚” “un-
cover,'’ or “ take up a coveriug.” Hence we have the verb re·
celo, ‘⁸ tc unveil,'’ recludo, “to uuclose,'’ resero, “ to unloek‚''
retego, “to nncover.” At a later period, however, this prefix
became merely emphatic, end as recondo meant “tc lay up,
or heard up diligently‚’' eo recludo, instead of denoting “to
open,” meant “to close up with special care:” whence cur
sense of the word “melnae” This change in the application
came into vogue in the silver ege, and we find in Suetonius

(octav. 78) retectrb pedebus in the sense “with his feet care- ,

fully covered’‘ (see the notes oi anaubon and Ernesti on this

passage). Similnrly, we find reccrco for secerno, refinnare=oe= 2

obedes (Fr. πίθηκον, reascrmer). It is an interesting circum·
stanes thet whereas cetego, detego, and revelo, decelo, were used

. tropically as synonyme in classical Latin (compare Hor. 3 '
