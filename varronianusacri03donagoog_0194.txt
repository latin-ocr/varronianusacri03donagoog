The first clue to the understanding of thie mysterious lan-
guage is furnished by the Etruscan transcriptione of well-known
Greek proper names, and by the Etruscan forms of those names
which were afterwards adopted by the Romans. This comparison

may at least supply some prena-facie evidence of the peculiari· r

ties of Tuscan articulatim, and of the manner in which the lan·
guage tended to corrupt itself.

Itis well known that the Etruscan alphabet possessed no
medice, as they are called. We are not, therefore, surprieed to
find, that in their transcriptione of Greek proper names the Etrus·
caus have substituted ἱεεινοεῑ. Thus, the Greek names, Ἀδρο-
στος, Τυδεύς, Ὀδυσσεύς, Μελέανγρος, and Πολυδεύκης, are
written Atreetle, Tute, istase, Malodes, and Peliala. But the
change in the bausniption goes a step farther thau this3 for, ρ
though they actually possessed the ιεννεο, they often convert

them into aspirata. Thus, Ἀγαμέμνων, Ἄδραστος, Θέτις,
Περσεύς, Πολυνείκης, Τήλεφος, become Arinem, Atrestlte,
Thetin, Pherae, Plataeae, lbelopke. Iu some cases the Greek ,

naues remain unaltered in the transcription, as in Πηλεύς,
Pele,· Παρθενοπαῖος, Parthenope ,⁸ Κάστωρ, Kestros-,- Ἡρω-
κλῆς, Herkte: and the Greek aspiratos sre also transferred, as
in Ἀμφιάραος, Amplior-e. These transcriptione of Greek names

even oi a conjecture. His own opinion sooms to be that tha language

was Turanian (p. 644, note 2); but there is no evidence whatever t'or that ,

ωρξοῧξιιῗιῃεεοειῆ to the Etruscan alphabet in generabit may be said

that it did not come direotly irem tha East, but irem the intermediate s
settlomente of the Pelasgian rece. When Mulier says (Etnuk. n. 290) ,
that it was derived irorn Graece, he cannot mean thet it passed orer into r
Italy subsequently to the commenoement ol Hellenic civilisation. The 3
mere fact that the writing eas from right to left, shows that tha Etnrecans Ῠ

derived their letters from the other peninsula, while its inhabitants arere
“ still Pelasgiau3 for there ars reryien eren of the earliest Greek inscrip-
tions ebich retain the original direction of the nriting (see Now Orat.
t 1013 Mulier, Etmsk. 11. p. 309). At the same time, the existence ol
hexameter verse in Etruria aad other elrcumstancee show thet there aas
a continued intercourse between the Pelasgo-Etnrscans and the Greeks
(Mulier, ibid. p. 292). On the Pelasgien origin oi tbe Etruscan alphabat¹
