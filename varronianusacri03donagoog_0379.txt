p. 146) ; polus (palad), dre. Masculine and feminines nouns in
-ι, are such os deno (dant), frona [frent-l, pora (port), wmes
(come), quiec (quaet), nepos (optet) ; a very long list of abstract
words in -toa (·tot·), as boni-tae, with a smaller number of supple-
mentary forms in -trro (tot), as virtue .· and active participles in
-na (nt), which are occasionally used arpennales corporo ( -
pant), dic. The genitive plural in -r‘om proves that there must
have been originally older forms in -tir of those nouns in -tor
-d, in which the characteristic is preceded by another consonant 3
ci. deor, gen. pl. dantium, with amerb. This remark applies
also to many of the nouns in -opata, welo, ebolo (see the exam·
, ples collected by Gorssen, 11. pp. 57, 58).

(β) Neuter nouus ot' this class originally and properly termi7
noted in -ι, Although capot, gen. copitar (for which the oldest
MSS. of Lucretius give capud), is the only word in which the
characteristic is retained unaltered, Greek analogias and many
oollateral indicatione enable us to see at once what nouus belonged
to this dental deolension. Some Greeks nouns in -pu= ματ· =
μεντ- (New Orat.w§ 114) have been naturalized in Latin, such aa
poento, gen. portentat,- and loo, gen. hori, retains more of the
termination in the nominative than the corresponding γάλα, gen.
potamon. The r, which is lost in κέαρ, cor, is represented
by the medial in καρδία, corde. Thongh carmen (cf. cannan-
εἰς), wareo (cf. ornantem), have omitted the characteristic t, not
only in the nominative, hut also in the oblique cases cormi-
air, opminrh, dio, they at all events retain the preceding liquid,
which is lost altogether in the Greek neuters in -μα, -ματος,
And while corpor, opor, dre. agree with τεῖχος in sostening the τ
into r, they retain some traco of it in the r of the oblique casea,
where the Greek, according to the rule (Now Orat. ᾗ 114), has

dropt the ς between the two vowels. There is an assimilation .

of the t in the oblique maes of or, oar-rio (cf. ¹der-corb, orel, ocellis
(cl. piu-r), sal, sellia and sar, famae. The exceptional forms
jacar (also jecinor), iter (also itiner), and juber, probably ended
originally in -rat‚ like the Greek ἧπαρ for ἦπρατ, gen. ἥπατος.
The following table will show the gradual degeneration of the
forms:

¹ The gen. pl. ocrim shows thot thir word stood for orti and belonged
to the a· doolension.
