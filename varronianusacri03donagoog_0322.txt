inscription was earved; otherwise we should hare had either
λυκοδορκας or hvpodoppoe. In fact, the word sena must bare
been originally λυφοος (loqueos), otherwise the lehial in the Latin
lupus would. be inexplicahle. Perhaps, too, ss Grati suggests
(ιι. s. p. 10, note 7), there are other Greek words containing
the syllable κο οι xv, which must bave been written with φ in
the older state of the languege. He seleets the following, of
which the Senserit equivalents have the palatals p, ch: edem,
cedmon, κόρση, κῶνος, mate, Senserit cudi, “purifiearl;”
malcho, “coneha;’' piros, “eaput;’' pri, “acuere” Lat. qonrnee ‚·
chyomo, “violaceus'’ The passage from Q, into po, κυ, dcc.
may be illustrated also by the converse change irem κυ to qs in
“ liquoriee,” from ιγλυκυῤῥίζα, de, while the English articulatien
of ‘⁸ een” hes entirely obliterated all traces of the Q in the Latin
- queo, originally patene (ef. nequinont for cre-queam), though the
German Ιοόιιηοπ still preserves this sound by implication¹.

If we examine the changes which have taken place in the
gntturals in their passage from the Reman to the Romanos leu-
guages‚ we are first struck hythe general tendeney· to soften
down or assibilate the tenuisc. The former process is effected
by a change of e into cn. compare the Latin mbollsee, eadere, c„
calcidae, mmero, eoem, capet, nomnen, mm, ceso, casmenas,
castas, caele, dre. with the Freneh cheod, edeoir, chauci, elom lt

,ἶ ¹ ἰ bre, chef, edorme, eloha, cher, obes, tdQ'qm, edente, σΙιοιιω, ’”
’ dre. Of the assibilation of e we have many instanoes: such
are, facimus, Fr fatove· lewe, lechin· plaeere, plos'es‘r5 dte.
Scaliger says (prima Scolr'perona, p. 114);ί ‘mutam semper
Gelli tollunt inter dues vocales.“ This is very often justified
by the transition from Latin te Freneh in the esse of gutturals

and dentale. Between two vowels c is sometimes drept; thus
the Icauna becomes the Yonne, theoseos becomes Troyeee and
similarly the Sequana is turned into the Seiae.

Another change in the Romanoa lenguages is the omission of
c when it is followed by e u: comp. dietas, It. dite, Fr. dier
pectes It. petto, Fr. petreae, dre. celso disappears in Freneh
when in the Latin form it was followed by 1e3 compare laesione¹

¹ We may compare quicquit-ios with the Greek κο-σκνἋλο), revenh·
