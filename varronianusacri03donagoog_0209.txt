inscriptionis genuine, we must divide prb-estqui est, and
then the meaning must be, “Avert the lire, Ο consuming
Vulcan, from the boundary which is here.”

Atracem, “ a vine that grows up trces.” Hesych. ἅταισον· ἅνα-
atropos, Τυῤῥηνοί. Can thisbe the Latin word adhesum?
Lucret. 1v. 1243: “tenve locis quianon potis est adfigere

Atriam, “the acediam? or commun hall in aRomau house.
Varro, L. L. v. 5 161: ‘⁶ Oneum adium dictum, qni loeus ,
tectus intra parietes relinquebatur patulus, qui asset ad bom·
munem omnium usum...Tuaconicum dictum a Tuscis, postea·
qnam illorum c'avnm aedium simulare coeperuut Atrium
appellatum ab Atriatibus Tuscis3 illinc enim exemplum sump-
tum.” Miiller (Etmuk. ij p. 256) adopts this etymology
(which is also suggested by Festus, p. 13), with the explana·
tion, that the name is not derived lrom Atrius because the
people of that place invented it, but frome reference to the
geographical position of Atrius, which, standing attha con-
fluence oi many rivers, might be supposed to represent the
compluvium of the utrium. This geographical etymology
appears to ms very far-fetched and improbable3 nor, indeed,
do I see the possibility of denving atrium from atrias ,· the
converse would be the natural process. There does not appear
to be any objection to the etymology suggested by Servius
(cd AEn.111.353): “ab atro, propter firmum qui esse solc-
bat iu atriaa:” and we may compare the corresponding Greek
term μέλαθρον. If atrium, then, was a Tuscau word, the
Latin ater also was of Pelasgiau origin. The connexion of
aream with αἴθριον, αἴθουσα, aa, suggested by Scaliger and
others, may be adopted, if we darive the word from the
Tnscau atras, which signifies “a day.” ¹ ⁸

Βαίιοω, “ the military girdle,’' is stated by Varro (Anrtq. R.
Ham. 18. ap. Scap. 1. p. 51) to have been a Tuscan word.
It also occurs, with the same meaning, in all the langnages of
the German family3 and we have it still in our word “ belt,'’
which bears a close resemblance to the Irelaudic noun belai-.-
wuo and the corresponding verb balta = niaque.

Barrus, “abeetle,'’ Hesych. Βυρῤός· κάνθαρος, Τυῤῥηνοί. Is this
the Latin word durren? Festus, p. 31: “ burmm dicebant
