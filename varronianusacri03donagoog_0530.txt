tahar-cinari, which is found only iu Plaut. Pers. 1. 3, 41, though
we have tuburcinatus (passive) in Appuleius, and mbarcincbrtadss
is quoted from Cato by Quintilian (1. 6, ad fin), it is difficult to
say what may be the origin of the first part of the compound, or
rather in what censs the implied taber is to be understood. It
seems, however, clear that this is the word in question, and thst

If we consider the Latin languagc only, we may conve·
niently distribute all the compound words into four clssscs.

(a) Detsrminative compounds are when the first part oi the
word defines the second ;‚ such arethe prepositional compounds:
cognomen, dedecus interrex, semideus, injuria, νιοβε, consul,
collcqa, pronepos, dre, where the prefix qualilies the meaning of
the whole word. In some cases the meaning is defined by an

, involved epithet, as in: mundium, luti-clami, lcttlfimdiam,

(h) Syntuctical compounds are when the first word is
governcd by the second, whether thc' regimen is that of s noun

case or adverb connected with a verb, as in: apricohr=qai wratis
colit, brevi-hiquens=hresiter loquum, ‚mudiwqui ntaleds'cit,
sipnifer=qui Quum fort,- and in the verbs derived from such
compounds, whether the intervening noun is still extant or n0t;
as: oqui-paromoen paro, costtp0=castam cqc, parqo=

s puram apo, drc. Tc the same class belongs auriqo from euripo
= cr aureuc=qui coreas opit, according to Festus (p. 8): “cn-
recoe, auriga. Aureus enim dicebant frenum quod ad aures
equorum religabatur3 meus quo ora coercebantur'' (cf. pp. 27, 4,
182, 23). If this interpretationis not sufficient, we must con·
sidcr the acres or ἄντυγες of the chariot as referred to in the
compound3 for as this term is applied to the sidepicces of the
