§ 9. The Neuter Forma.

The neuter accusative, which serves also as a nominative
(see Neu Orat. ξ 236), ends, like the usual accusative, in -τι in
all nonns cf the vowel-declensions There is no doubt, however,
that this m may be traced back through the dental liquid a,
which represents itin Greek, to the dental mute ·d or -t Thus
we have i-d, illa-d, qao-d, &c to the latest period of the lan-
guage; we have also anat, tet, eet, or med, ted, τεὼ· τρο-τιεί,
maanes, ted-apem, interced (serat. &maala de Bacch. ll. 132
14), and we shall see in tha next chapter that the final a or
τ, in nouus like corpu-s, rabo-r, penu-a, dm, is a softening of an

“ original t or d. We must take care not to couftrse this t ord ,

with the same letter appearing as theaffix of the ablative. The
long vowel, which precedes the dentalia that case, shows that
there is apocope or absorption of something more than a mere
consonant, and abundant reason has been given for‘the inference
that this dhas passed through th from an original sibilant repre·
senting the second pronominal clement. On the contrary, the

accusative m, a, dor t is merely the residuum of the third pro· ,

nominal element, denoting simple objectivity. The forms of the
neuter plural show, hfmtiori, that the dental affix in the singular
was amere letter, and not a syllable, as in the case of the
ablativa. For all neuter nouns, to whatever declension they
belong, form their plural nominative-accusative in din the chd
and in the old European languages of this family. Now the
Greek language shows us that a, when it stands by itself at the
end of awcrd, or precedes a dental mute, may be changed into
' ἄ, and this vowel may even represent the combination -ντ, Thus
we have πάτερᾰ for πάτερν, τετύφωται for τετύφνται, σωζοίατο
for σώζοιντο, πάθος fer πένθος, and even δέκα for δέκεντ, and
σῶμα for σώμεντ. There is therefore no objection, affabri,
to the hypothesis, bnt rather a presumpti0n‚ that the plural -ἅ
represents an original -vr3 and it seems quite reasonable to
assume that ξύλαπξὺλψη for if the objectiva v or rof the '
singular had to be extended into a plural, we should not in this
case append the personal or subjective a, as in the case of mas·
culina and feminine nouus, but should rather repeat the objectiva

affix. Now it is known that the neuter plural in Latin originally
