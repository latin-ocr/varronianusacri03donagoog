confused by studente, that Iri-dene, “a mattcclr,'’ merely involves
tic but thet Iri-dena, “a sheep‚” is for ambi-dena (Festus, p. 4:
“amdcidena sive ballene ovis appellabatur, quae superioribus et
inferioribus eet dentibns”).

The formation of the degrees of comparison in adjectivae and
adverbs is intimately connected with thet of the numerals. For
all ordinale are of the natine of superlatives, and the most ge-
nuine form ol the comparative in the Indo-Gennenic langueges
isthe combination of prcnominal clemente, which forms the
third numeral, consideredas indicating something beyond two.
Although the Latin language ie almost the only idiom which
exhibite the foll development ol the separate usage of the lorrn

⁴ tenum (Nem orat.§157),for ithae not only the numeral

under the forms tres, ter, aree, ter-tice, but also a nonii ter·
' minue, and aregnlar proposition hana, it does not use -ter as a
comparative suffix except in the case of pronominnl forms. For
all common words we have instead of -tcr, -τερος, ωας, which
are so usual in cognate langnegee‚ either the merely relative
adjective in due, corresponding to the Senserit dyas, Greek -ιος,
or a derivative from this in λον, corresponding to the Senserit ·
tyto, Greek -cov=·cov·c; where we may compare the adverbs
in -e‘ene with their more recent forms in -r‘ec Thus we have

· both ator end ‹tl-ius, and from the same root acl-tra, otim.

Many prepositions havea fixed or adverbial form in -tra, which
is extended by the eddition of -ior into en inflected comparative.
Thus we have σι’-ἱνα, oter-ior, ecc-tra, ceter-ior, eir-tra, iri-ter·-
r'or‚ ulta, ulter-thr, doc. The forms anter-ior, decer-rim pos-
ter-rin, show that there must heve been originally derivativee
like arr-tro, ‹Ie-tra, poc-tro, ae well es the existing arc-te, de,
poet[e] ; and we have seen that pos-tro is still extant in Umbriam
In some words the original affix was -ra only, asin infra,
cop-ra, whence insnum, copert'or. Some prepositions have no ·
intermediate adverb in -na or -να, but merely add the termine-
tion -ἰυν, es prior ‘from prta, propior from prope5 and to thie
class we must add pejor for pce-chr, from per. This form and
its superlative pessima are assigned to malus. But, paradoxicnl
ae it may appear et first sight, there seems to be good reason for

the belief that in pointel regular derivation the true comparative
⁴of moloc is mel-ior, which is assigned to the correlativedonna.
