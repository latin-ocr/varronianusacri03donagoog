ablativo (for thoy were originally identical) denotas motion from
aplane, or, generally, separation3 the dative or locutive implica
rest ia a place, or, generally, conjunction3 and the accusative
significa motion to a place, or, generally, approach with a view
to conjunctiora ; bnt that these primitive uses oi the oblique in·

flexione have become obsoleto in Latin, with the exception of a ,

few general nouns and the proper names of citios. In other
instances, motion from and to, and rest io a place, together with
the other mutual relations ot' words, are expressed by some pre-
position ; and in this use of the prepositions, the genitiva as dis·
tinet tium the ablativo, and the dative, whether identified with
the locstive or distinguished from it, ars utterly excluded. The

ablativo alone is used with those prepositipns which signify ·

separation, and takes the place oi the dative or locutive with
those which imply rest or conjunction, while llic accusative pro-
perly accompanias those which denote approach or motion.

, It will be convenient to class the Latin propositione under
three haads, corresponding to the three primitive distinctions ol
the oblique emes-namely, separation or motion frona, rect in,
aad approach er motion to. 'To each of these may be appended
the derived or componnded prepositions, which introduce some
new modification of meaning.

The three simplest auxiliaria of the primitive relations of
case are ab (shortened in a, and extended into ahs, aesque) for
the expression of saporam or motion from, with the ablative3
ia for the expression of rest tit or oa, with the ablativa, as the ’
usnrper of the place os the dative or locativc; and ad for the
expression of approach or motion to with the accusative.

There is no doubt as to the origin and linguistic affinitics of
these propositione. Ab or aba corresponds in etymology and
meaning to the Greek ἀπό or ride, which was originally ‹iv-wdc,
or amir (Now Orat. ξ 169), and, as such, denoted motion from
a distant object to the subject, according to the principle which
Ihave stated and elucidated elsewhere (Now Orat. §5130, 169;
cr. Gr. Art 77 sqq.). Praeticslly ab and ἀπό denota motion from
the snriaee of an object, and are so distinguished from oo (ο),ἐξ
(ἐκ), which imply that we pass through intermediato proximity 3,
ὄπ corresponds in use to the Greek band εἰςεένς, and in origin
not only to these propositione, but also to daei. In with tho
