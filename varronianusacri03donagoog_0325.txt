never was a Papirius of patrician rank, when it is certain that
they were patricii minorum pontium? To begin with the first
of these, Iwill instance L. Papirius Mugillanus, who, in the year
of the¹ city 312, was censor with L. Sempronius Atratinus, who
had previously (Luc. 310) been his colleague in tho consulship.
But your family-name at that time was Papisius. Alter him
there were thirteen of your ancestors who were curule magis·
tratas before L. Papirius Crassus, the first of your family that
disused tho name Papisius. This Papirius was chosen aanor
in aum. 415, with L. Papirius Cursor for his mopshter equitum,
and four years afterwards he was elected consul with K. Duilius.”
We must conclude, therefore, that Appius Claudius used his oen·
sorial authority to sanction a practice, which had aheady come
into vogue‚ and which was intimately connected with the pecu-
lisrities of the Roman articulation. In fact, the Romans were to
the last remarkable for the same tendency to rhotacism‚ which is
characteristic of the Umbrian, Dorian, and Old Norae dialecto.

§a mosao.

The Romans had five dentale or lingnals: the mutes 1) and
T, the liquids 1. and N, and the secondary letter a, which in
most alphabeta is considered a liquid, but in the Latin stands for
an aspiration or assibilation of the medial 1). Grimm's law, as

applied to the dentale, stands thus:
