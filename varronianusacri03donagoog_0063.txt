caym is clearly the saure as that of Pelope. There are two
Niobes inGreeh mythology, daughters, the one oi Phoroneus,
the other of Tantalus—the latter is the sister oi Pelops,·the
former the mother of Palmyrae. The syllable πελ· standsin
thesaure relation to psa- that πέδσ does to μετά. The original
form of the root signifying “bluchness” was ιμελ-Ῑς but the
labinl generally pradominsted over the guttural clement Of the
lubial forms, that with the oenuis usually came to signify ‘⁴ livid’*
rather than “black;” as we see in the words πέλως, πελιδνός,
dcc. Apollodorus expressly says* that Πελιάς was so called ba
cause his face was rendered livid (πέλως) hy a hielr from a
horse3 audit is obvious that liband, which signifies “dank-
faced'’ or “swarthy,'' is an ethnioal designation which differs
from the well-known name Αἰθίοψ only in the degree oi blach-

ness which is implied. The Αἰθίοπες were the “burntfaoed ¹

people” (σιοι India torret, as Tibullus says of them, 11. 3, 59),
andare described as perlectly hlack (Jeremc'ah xiii. 233 κυάνεοι,
Hes. op et Dies, 525); whereas the Πέλοπες were only dark
in comparison with the Hellenes⁸. On the whole, it can hardly

· be doubted that the Πελασγοί were, according to the neme

given thern by the old inhabitants of Grecos, “the swarthy
Asiatics‚” who were called by the latter part oi their name
along the coasts of Asia Minor; and thus the cognate tcrms
neumae and Πελ-σσγοί point to an emigration from Asia
Minor to Argolis indisputably connected with the progress of
Phoenician civilisetion. The former part of the name was not
necessary in the mother-country, where all were dash complex·
ioned; and the latter partos the word, which denoted the Asiatic
origin oi the Πελωγρί, was dropt in the synonym Πελμοψ,
which signifies merely “ swarthy of faoe⁴.” Ι
