bility of my speaking;” consequently drbaro=dic=ae=rim must
mean, “there is a probability of my having spoken;” and in
proportion as the former approximates to the predication‚ “I
shall speak‚” in the same proportiou does the latter express, “I
shall bave spoken.” In strictness that which is called afuturum
11111111, or paulopost-flitmum, cen only exist 11 forms derived

from the perfecto of intransitive verbs. These forms exist in ,

Greek both with the active and with the middle inflexions; thus
from θνήσκω, “I am dying,” τέθνηκα, “I am dead,” we have
τεθνήξομαι or τεθνήξω, “Ι shall have died‚” i. e. “I shall be
found 11 tlre state 11 death;” from γράφω, “Ι am writing‚” vre
have «γέγραφα, “Ι bave written,’' γέγραμμαι, “l have Men
written‚” i. e. “ Ι stand or remain 11111111,”«γσγράψομαι, “ Ι shall
have been written,” ic. “I shall standand remaiu writteu.”
Now it has boen observed even by the old mammarium, that
the Romans did not use these futures 11 the intransitive or
passive perfect. Thus Priscian says (Lib. v111. c. 8, p. 388,
Krehl): “quamvis Graeci futurum quoque diviserunt in quibus-
dam verbis, in fictarum infinitum, ut πίψομαι, 11 poulo-post-
futurum ut ambiciosa—melius 111111 Romani considerata futuri
ratione, quae omniuo incerta cst, simplici in eo voce utuntur, neo
finiunt apetiam futari.'‘ But 11 tha Romans bad no siccarum
11111111 11 the passive form, still 1111 would they have one vvith
active inflexione. The question 11 moods, as we 'have scen
above, is not one of forms, but oue of syntactical usage. And 11
we wish to inquire whether there is any justification for those
who place fimo in the indicative mood, we have only to ascer-
tain whether there is really buy difference in syntactioal usage
between this form andficcrim, and generally, whether the 11111,
which we call perfect subjunctive, is ever used as en indicative,
thetis, as 1 categorical predication‚ without any reference to e
protasis, expresscd or plainly implied. The confusion, into
which some modern grammarians have fallen in regard to this
tense, has 111111 entirely from the use 11 the Latin subjunctive
in the spadonis, without a qualifying particle 11 reference like the
Greek dv. Hence the imperfect grammarian ie extremely liable
to confuse between a categorical and 1 consequential 1111111111,
where the protasis is omitted3 aud while the Greek optative,
with da, is rendered by the future indicative, without any risk
