the socalled Τρννθοπί or Tyrsear' were the most civilised branch ’
of that family. Herodotus, the great traveller of his time, vves ι

more entitled than any of hie contemporaries to form ajndgment
on the subject, aud' he obviously identifies the Pelasgians with the
- Tyrrhenians on the coast of Asia Minor, in Graece, aud in Italy.
It is perhaps oue of the many indicatione os the literary inter-
course between Herodotus aud Sophocles, which Ι have else·
where established, that the latter, iu a fragment of his Inachus,
· mentions the Tynhenc-Pelasgiaus among the old inhabitants of
Argos‘. Lepsius³ has fully shown that the name Τυρῤηνός or

0
formed one of the original elementa of the population of Graece, the
division into Doriana and Ioniaus corresponding to the oppositiones
Hellenas tc Pelasgians. In the course of his travels he had met with
pure Pelasgians in Placia and Scylaceon the Hellespont, and also in
Orestem and their language differed so far from the Greek that he did
not serapte to call it barbarian (c. 57). At the same time he seems to
have been convinced that the Hellenas owed their greatness tc their
coalition vrith these herhardus Pelasgians (c. 58). The text of Herodotus
is undoubtedly corrupt in this passage; but the meaning is clear from
the context. He says, that “the Hellenes having been separated from
the Pelasgians, being veah and starting from small beginnInga have
increased in populaticn, principaliy in consequence of the accession of
the Pelasgians and many other barbarous tribes.” The reading αὔξηται
ἐκ πλῆθος τῶν ἐθνέων πολλῶν is manifestly vrong; not only because the
position of the article is inadmissible, but also because dilen ἐθνέων
βαρβάρων συχνῶν immediately fehovs. I cannot doubt that ve ought to
read αθξηπαε r’r πλῆθος, τοῖν Πελασγῶν μάλιστα προσκεχωρηκότων αὐτῷ καὶ
ὅλλον ε’θνέον βαρβάρων auxeris. The spithet πολλῶν has crept luto tha
text from emarginat explanation of συχνῶν, and raia ἐθνέων πολλῶν hes
consequentIy taken the place of the abbreviation τᾶν narde [ΠΛΛων]
for τῶν Πελασγόν.
