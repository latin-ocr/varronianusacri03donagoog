sufficient to make the following observatione: (a) the Latin s,
though not= v, contained that letter, and was a cognate sound
with it¹: this is proved by a comparison of coafme, ooa-
ve‘oc, &a with cota-hibere, rin-primas, dre. (b) It appears from
Quintilian that in his time the Latin 1⁴* contained, in addition to ’
’ the labial v, some dental sibilant ; and the sibilant is known to
have been the condition in which the guttural passed into the
mere aspirate. (o) A comparison of the Greek θήρ with its p
Latin synonym fera would produce great difficulty, ifwe could p, ’·
not suppose a coexistence cl the sibilant with the labial in the
latter; such a conam-rencs we have in the Russiau synonym
secra, Lettish scelere, Old Prussian scira. (d) The Sabine words
mentioued above (such as ficeta), the more modern representa-
tives of which substitute an aspirata lor the Ρ, prove that the
rmust have contained a guttural aspirate; forno labial can
pass into a guttural‚ though a compound of labial sard guttural

may be represented by tlre guttural only. (a) These words in
the Romanoa languages which present an aspirata for the r
which their Latin synonyme retained to the last-such as

falco, “hawk;'’ finis, Fr. “hors;” facere, fiormom, firmas, 2¹¹, Ι Α

dra, Sp. “hasen’' “ he1·moso,'’ “humo'’ &c.,-prove that, to
the last, the Latin s contained some guttura] element, in addition l
to the labial ol which it was in part composad. It seems to me l
that r must have been εν, or, ultimately, Ην, and that vmust (ζ
have correspondcd to our· English w. With regard to the Greek .
φ, there can he no doubt that it was a distinct p'h, like the⁴
middle sound in bap-kaacrd, alrop-lrerd,· reduplications like ⁴
πέφυκα (pe-phalea), and contacte like Scapul (Sopp'lro), suffi-
ciently prove this. The forms of Latin words which seem to
substitute ulcr this φ must be referred to the Pelasgian clement
in the Latin language: the Tuscana, as we have seen, were by
no means averse from this sound; and the Romans 'were obliged
to expressit by the written representative of a very different
articulation.

² In the same way as s seems to represent φ in the instantes cited
above, v also appears aa a substituto both for φ andja Compare otricus,
colim, cera, sirpo, aud citriam with φολκός, patra, nipe, παρθένος, and
pata· (Buttmann, Lavit. s. v. φολκός).
