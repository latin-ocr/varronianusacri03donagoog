01 the langnage, in its iufancy‚ its maturity, and its decay.

The most distinct and virid picture of the Latin lauguage is,
therefore, to be derived from a consideration 01 this peculiarity,

I. With regard to the written forms in which the Latin
language has been handed down to ua, it would not, perhaps, be
too large an assertion, if we said that every etymological diffi-
