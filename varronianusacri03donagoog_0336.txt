which have n in the inflexions (eg. aymo, amad, egmuzum,
above, pp. 144‚159), is peculias· to the Oscan ; sor the influence
of the last m is sufficient to explain the usual first person in ο by
the eide of inquam and earu.

The next comparison, in point of weight which suggests it·
self, is that between the secondary vowels 1 and 113 and· in order
to make this comparison satisfactorily, it will be well to consider
first their subdivisione. It appears, then, that there are three
distinct uses ol each ol these vowcls: 1 is (1) every long vowel,
the representative ofthe diphthoug n1=nn3 (2) avowelosmedium
length, frequently as we have seen above, the representative of
c, the first part of that diphthong3 (3) a very short vowel ap-
proximating to the sound of the shortest υ, and used chiefly
before R. Similady, υ is (1) a very long vowel, the represen-
tative of the diphthong 01=0n3 (2) a vowel ol medium length,

· generally answering to ο, the first part of that diphthong3 (3) a

very short vowel, approximating to the sound of the shortest 1,
and used chiefly before L. The cld Italicus had separate cha·
racters for 1,and u„ which differed from the other characters by
the additiones certain marks: Ι, was written t, like the Greek
spiritus asper, and U, was written Υ. It is remarkable that the
emperor Claudius, when he introduced his new letters into the
Roman alphahet to express the consonant v, the Greek ψ, and
the modification 1„ while he inverted the digamma (thus :ll to

express the first, and joined two sigmas (thus )() to express the ' ,

second, which was consequently called catabipmc (Priscian, p.
545, Putsch; Ι. p. 40, Krehl), was contented to borrow the third

from the old alphabet of the Oscans.

The following examples will justify the subdivision which Ι
have made of the vowels 1 and U.

L.—In composition we find this long vowel in the root-
syllable ol words which contain the dipthong cs'=ca Thus,
· from cca-timo we have ec-ista'nao5 from ωφιιιιε we have ias-iquan,⁴
from coedc, coa-cido, oc-cido,· from bado, ccl-lsi103 from quero,
s'n-qua’r05 &c We may recognize the same substitution in via
for cic-sb, &a This long 1, as we have seen, also represents the
diphthong nl, and it is used as a contraction for 11, especially in
the genitives of nouns in -s'ua It has been already mentionedthat,
when employed for either of these purposes, it is expressed in the
