only two exceptions-the verb eo (root i) and the verb queo
(root quea- or frou). These two verbs are distinguished from
the regular verbs in ι’ by their omission of the e in the imperfect
rbem quibam, and hythe adoption of the agglutinata form in
the futures i-bo, quibo. With· regard to the former point,
although we have occasional exceptione in the poets, as barba,
potebant, (ke, we generally find that the imperfect of thei verb
ends in -r'ebamJ as audie-bam ,· and in this particular it is imi-
tated by the semi-consonant verb in i, which gives capiebam,
fumidam, frrya‘ebam, dic. With regard to the future, we rarcly‚
if ever, find an -i verb which follows the anelogy of ibo, quibo;
but in almost every case we have the subjunctive form in am
(aa, et, &ab which is invariably adopted by the consonant
verbs. The substitution ofe for ί in the verb a), which does
not involve the formative element of the second conjugation,
leads to some momentary confusion with the c- verb‚ in those
instances in which eo is used as an agglutinato auxiliary to
express the passive of certain compounds of do and facab, just as
the -eo verb stands as the corresponding intransitive to verbs
merely differing from it in conjugation. Thus we have fater-eo,
“I go between,” i.e. vanish, by the side of interficfa “ I cause
to go between,’' i.e. make away with; per-eo, “I go through,'’
i. e. disappear, by the side of per-do, “I put through,” i. e. anni· '
hilatc3 and similarly, parum-do (cf. πέρθω); cea-ee (= acaum
co), “I gofer salc,’‘ ie. ·“I am sold,¹' hythe side of ven-de
(wesema, “I put up for sale,” and eea-dico or afri-drea
(= mundabo), “I declare for sale.” But the confusion is only
momentary, for the first comparison shows that these verbs
are distinguished from the neuter verbs mentioned above (as
puteo, pendeo, sedeo) both by the conjugation of the present
(in eo, -cs, -et, dte, not -co‚ -cb, -ίι, dre.) and by the form of the
perfect (which is never in -ἰυῦ, On the other hand, we must
distinguish the causative verbs in eie, Greek -θω, from the aorist
formatioris in -θην -ην, which involve the clement ys, und have
precisely the converse meaning. Of these latter forms enough
has been said elsewhere (Nero Orat. ἓξ 379, sqq.). Ι will only
remark in passing, that the explanationes these forms will not
justify the monstrosity ἐγρηγόρθασι, in which all the gram·
marians have acquiesced. As this word rests only on a single
