as it appears in the oldest forms of Latin, and in certain Greek
mchaisms, was unqneetionsbly most nearly allied to the Solavo-
nian: we cannot, therefore, doubt that this was thc origin of the
Pelasgian people, especially as there is no evidence or argument
to the contrary.

But, to return to Italy, who were the old inhabitants oi that
peninsula? Whom did the Pelasgians in the first instance con-
quer or drive to the mountains? What was the origin of that
hardy racc, which, descending once more to the plain, subjugated Δ
latium, founded Rome, and fixed the destiny os the world?

The Umbriam, Oscens, Latins, or Sabines-for, in their
historical appearanoes, wc must consider them as only different
members of the same family-are never mentioned as foreigncrs.
We know, however, that they must have had their Transpadanc
affinities as well as their Pelasgian rivals. Itis only because
their Celtic substratum was in Italy before the Pelasgians
arrived there, that they are called aborigines. The differcnce
between them and the Pelasgians is in effect this: in examining
the ethnical affinitics of the latter we have tradition as well
ns comparative grammar to aid us; whereas the establishmcnt -
of the Umbrian pedigree depends upon philology alone.

Among the oldest langnages of the Indo-Germanic family
not the least remarkable is the Lithuanian, which stands first
among the Sclavenian dialects¹, and bears a nearcr resemblance
to Senserit than any European idiom. It is spoken, in different
dialects, by people who live around the south-east corner of the
Baltic. One branch ol this language is the old Prussien, which
used to be indigenous in the sam-and or “Fen-country” be·
tween the Memel and the Pregel, along the shore of the Ossaeae
