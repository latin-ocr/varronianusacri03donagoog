baclrwards and forwerda contained in ἐπί and ἀμφί (περί). For
example, occupo is either ἐπιλαμβάνοι) or περιλαμβάνω. ’ The
proposition circam (circu, circiter), which i's limited to the local
or temporal meaning of περί, is a case of the substantive caina,
which may be connected with cia (citro), a form of the prono- ¹
minal clement -ee,· and ci-tra, citro are opposed to ulna, alno,
as ce=“here” is opposed to al· (ab, cc, it, in-) =“there,”
· aud there is no doubt that the proposition in is ultimately iden·
tical with the pronouu ab, al· (cf. Sanam. onya, Greek κεῖνος,
dcc). The pronominal root ce obtains another prepositional ex·
·tension in cam = fdaand this again has its comparative in eon·
tra, “against” implying extension from and infrontat thet
which is here. ·'l¹hexfirst clement po- combined with the second
-a and the third -n gives in po[s]na a sense ol extension “ back-
wards'’ and ⁴‘ behind‚’' i. e. through all three positions; and thia
isalso the meaning of pos-t, which bears the same relation to
poete that are-d or sat does to ιη’-ηε. The latter, which is really
po-a-rw without the first syllable, expresses the idea of simple
separation. The compound post, or even the syllable po alone,
is used as a proposition almost equivalent to trans, aa in po-
marium or poemerium, “the space beyond the wall,” post·
liminium, “the space beyond the threshold, within which a
resumption of civic rights is possible.’' Trans, involving the
elementa of the comparative suffia, with anew affin, differs little
from altra, ior it includes nearly the same elementa in a dif-
ferent order. As cir-cua is probably connected with cis, so ter·
minua undoubtedly oonains the root of aab. A fiais or tei·-⁴
minua strictly excludes the citra as well astho alh-u, and the
circaea, as a line, is neither the space which it encloses, nor that,
which it shuts out Erpa, which bears the same relation to
erqo that ultra does to' ultro, must be explained by the eorre-

spondenee of erqo aud igitur. The latter, as we have seen, is '

au extension in -wr=·taa of iya=eayi5 and erp-caspe is
only a different form of the same word; for the ending of igitur
is ·tur=-tim, and while ¹circa stands by circi-tar we shall see
directly that jacta presumes a jacta-tim. ’

It has been shown (in Chapter vnn) that clam, coram peries
aud tenus are adverbs derived from nominal or verbal roots;
and jacta ἠως-πα ia a compouud of the root jug· in jaapo
