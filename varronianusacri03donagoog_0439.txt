at once that the Latin verb is much more complete than the
Greek: and besides these forms, which admit of direct compa-
rison, the Latin neuter verb has a present 'subjunctive fimum
fim‘cm, a pluperfect indicative ptr-erem =firesom, a perfect snb-
junctive fiaere'm (or fitero)=firoe-ca'm, and a corresponding plu· ’
perfect firr'ssem fferre-serim. The ειν, which appears iu the
laet three of these forms, is best explained by a comparative
analysis of πέφυκα and firi=firfira As ί is the regular ex-

· ponent of guttural vocalisation, as the guttural, before it subsides
into r‘,is generally softeued into rand lr, and as we lind k, ab
in the perfect and aorist of Greek verbs, we see that πέφυκα
compared with firfin‘ presumes an intermediate fufius, and thus,
bya transposition aud substitution quite analogous to the French
change of lthrough al into rr, we get the following explanation
of the existing forms of the Latin perfect, in accordance with the
assumption of au original inflexion in sc.

sepo-safra] fiffm=s¹⁴s¹⁴l⁸=fi⁴fltl
«ἔφυ-ως (or -det cf. alc-do) flesto-mlta =fufisfu=tf

adpo-rvr (for m) fhfiewt=fufuhrf=fltfirlt
πεφῦ-ωμω (for -με-ς) sasenamwsafiaem :joselmus
redden-rr (for wer) fusura-tis =fisfitf=t=tt⁸t

πσφΰ-κα-σι (for ψη) · susm-Mt =sufiw=ml =fitfimnh

une a, which appare before the με in ue dautes nemone
of the Latin perfect, assumes the weaker form of e in the pluper-
teet, which must originally have corresponded in termination to
the perfect, though the losa of the distinguishing augment has
obliged the Latin langnage to have recourse to a variatiou of the ”
affines in the secondary tenses. Thus, while we must have hed
originally efiasuaa by the side of firfitsa, the former has become
fierem, while the latter has shnmk into fiai. We must take
care not to confuse between the ἰ, which represents a lost e iu .
firi, and that whieh appears as the characteristic of the subjunc-
tive mood in fleam qia-fam and 'in firsrim =fira·sim ,· for
. although there is every reason to believe th'at the e=r of the ,
fut and perf. is really identical ultimately with the ι’ of the:
subjunctive, the actual functione are different iu the cases which
require to be discriminated. Originally, no doubt, foc-sim and
sarem =fierim were firtures indicative which had corresponding
aorists3 but like the Greek conjunctive, which was originally
