adduce seme passages, in which the differenec between the
written and the spoken lengrmge of ancient Rome is expressly
recognized.

When Cicere's Crassus (de Oratore, 111. 11, ᾗ 41) is speak-
ing of the true mode of pronouncing Latin, he says: “I donet
like the separate letters to be either proncnneed with pedentie
aecuracy, or slnrred over too carelessly.'' This shows that,
though an uncdueated ceunhyman might represent by his arti-
culation too little of the written word, it would be a fault, on the
other hand, if the scholar recollected teo much of his spelling.
Again, Suetonius, who had seen the chirograph of Augustus
(Vir. Oetae. c. 87), writes thus about his method of spelling

(c. 88): “ He did not strictly attend to orthography,-that is, ·

the method and lawe of writing as taught by the grammaticus,-
on the contrary, he seems rather to adopt the opinion of those
who think that we should write just aa we talk. For as tobis
often ehanging or omitting not letters only, but whole syllables,
this is a common inaccuracy3 nor would I remark the fact, did it
not appear strange to mc that he should have superseded a een-
sular legate as being illiterata, because hc saw in his handwriting
e'ei for rpei.'’ From this itis clear, that in the time of Augustus
pcople did not proueunee as they wrote. Quintilian, too, ex-

pressly tells us (lest. Orat. xl. 3, 533), that, “although itis ’

necessary, on the one hand, to articulate every word, yet itis
wearisome and diegusting te take account of every letter, and as,
it were to reckon them up: for not only is the cresis ol vowels
very common, but even some of the consonante are disguised
when a vowel follows ;” and then he quotes the examples of
both ecthlipsis and synalaepha in Virgil's maltam ille et terrae.
Mueh to the same effect are Cicero’s remarks about the conple-
ts'ncta'e verborum er avoidance of the hiatus by a kind of mesta
or synizeais (Orator. c. xxm. ξ 78), and he says expressly

· that the Latin lauguage repudiates a concurreuce of vowels

(Orator. cexmv. §1502 ‘⁴ qued quidem Latina lingua sie ob-
servat, nemo uttam rusticus sit, qui vocales nolit conjungere”).
From these and other passages which might be quoted, we

perhaps every observing render of the Latin dramatists, especially unco
the time ef Bentley, may hare arrived at semeoimilar conclusion.
