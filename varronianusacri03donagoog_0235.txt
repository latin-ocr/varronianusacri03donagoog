{llam ‘ luctuum‚’ l. ‘calamitatum series vel stium discussio' ’¹
The connexion of this word with traho brings it into still greater
affinity with theold langnages of Italy, and the evidence frum
the context ie conclusive for the meaning. Many Etruscan in·
scriptione like those quoted above (pp. 207, 208), introduce eoa,
ceu, or cclcc, which are obviously pronouns or adverbs signifying
‘thiu’ or ‘here’ in accordance with the root'k· which appears in
all the Indo-Germanic languages. The Oervetri inscription has
taught us (above, p. 200) that cru signifies ‘earth’ (N. Η. G.
orda, Goth. circha, Altfr. inho, Gr. ἔρα). Consequeutly, crece
would naturally denote an earthenware veesel, for -elcais a' very
common termination in ¹Icelundic numae as bera-alca “ childish·
ness,” iusta, “ malice,” &c And as cco ot celcra is found in
similar connexions‚ cca must be the feminine of the pronominal
adjective cece, wo, acum, egreeing with crece We have in
Etruscan inscriptions not only cca but cc, acken and ocal as
pronouns corresponding to the Umbrian' cao (see Fabretti, a η). ‚
'Aa colummis clearly the locative of achor which occurs in the
great Perugian inscription, and which at once suggests the Icc-
landic afer, Germ. acher, aper, we may fairly conclude that occ
is the preposition which. under the form aa, nale, nach, is found
in all the Teutonic and Sclavonian longuages: and thus the
Vulci inscription will mean: “ this earthen vessel in the ground
isa votive offering of sorrow.” ’ ’
’ By the side of cca pdkrce we have, on larger monuments,
'ccc or cellen autfrc‘ or cuthincel. Thus we find:

’ coa cethi Londicl Celeia (Dennis, 1. p. 500).
colico meti tinctio theca (V ermigliolt 1. p. 118, ed. 2).
ceo euthiuccl Titaie (Dennis 1. 242, 443).
ccc astisinate sitiat (Vermiglioli, 1. p. 131, ed. 2). ·
Here again the Icelandic comes to our aid, for cut is dolor.
moectc’ta'a, luctus, and is so completely a synonym of trapi thet we

have trepnor and πιεῖν in the same stanza of Hamdrssc-Mal (Edd.

tamena 11. p. 488); and mla or ducah εῄτιίε, lcrqucus: so
that we may translate ccc cethi, “this is the mourning‚” and
cca natinaei, “ thie is the sorrowful inscription¹.'’ Comparisons'
