zeal, do not suggest any'argument or motiva, which should in-
duce us to neglect or discourage the study of the old Roman
literature. Though the Latin tongue will never again become
the spoken lenguage of Europe, there is no reason why it should
not resume its place as the organ of literary communication-
why, with its powers of conciseneas and abbreviation, and with
its appropriation of all the conventional terms of scienoe and art,

. it shouldnot still flow from the pens of those who have truths

and facts to communicate, and who are not careful to invest or
disgnise them ¹in the emhellishments of some modern and fashion·
able style. , This at least is certain, that the Latin language has
struck its roots so deeply and so permanently in our own lan·
grege, that we cannot extirpate it, if we would3 for we must
know Latin, if we would thoroughly understand our own mother-
tongue3 and even those who are least learned, and most dis-
poscd to undervalue classical attainnrents, are very liable to
further what others would call the corruption of our languege,
hy the introduction of new terma erroneonsly formed after a
Latin model¹. Itis, therefore, not nnreasonable to expect that,
whatever changes may take place in the professional edu·
oetion of Englishmen-though the Universities may cease to
hestow the highest degrees in their faculties upon those who
have passed through the Latin exercises of their schools—though
the meeting of Convocation may never again be inaugurated
with a Latin sermon et St Paul’s—though a study of J nstinian
and Gaius may be pronounoed of no use to the lawyer—though
even Roman history may lose its general interest-though phy-
siciens may decline to proscribe and apothecarics to disperse ac-
cording to the phraseology of a Latin materia medrito—though
