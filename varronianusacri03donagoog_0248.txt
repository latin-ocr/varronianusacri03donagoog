the Runic uafri, A. S. ud, with (demonstare, Engl. aster, Umbr.
boat, madro), ‘⁴ his servm Etlns on the sepulchral excavation a
prayer for the dead‚” i. e. ‘⁴ hier eut hinter theovs seins nefa
thaam lautnesela lat kare Aulee Iarthial frtgu thverraai” We
should come, however, to a similar conclusion if tha-ea were
compared with the Pelasgo-Hellenic θεῖος, “an uncle* rethor
than with θός, “a servant'' Iu fact, the two words fall into a
remarkable agreement with one another and with the Pelasgic
aud German worda denoting divinity; cf. (a) thyr, thece, dio, dm.
“a servant,” (b) θεῖος, modern Tuscan aab, (Perng. Inscr. aia)
“au nucle,” (c) Tyr, Ta‘v, Zio, “Gau” (Grimm. D. M. p. 175,
wdehorn, p. 130, s. v. Famel). To say nothing of the possible
interchange in the ideae of relationship and servitude which
might bring back detor and θής to a common originin the San·
ecrit dtamen, marea, poter-familiar, the form of the word
deice in its other meaning sufficiently shows that a labial is ah·
aorbed, aud this would account lor the identity ot’ liei-ora= oeta,
and the Etruscan tha. For the gen. here, cf. lbra in our Ybeaday
with ita original form stowam The name of a relation, how-
ever, ismore tobe expected here than thetole servant The pre·
position lizathio, with the gen. may be compared with the Gothic
use of hindana, e. g. Ulola Mc. 111. 8. 'rhet this root occurred in
the Umbrica we have already secu (above, p. 10). It ia not at all
uecemerythat the preposition should bear the comparative sonu.
On the Runic inscriptions we have not only the comparatives
r’flir, efr and the like, but also the positive forms cafia', at, dre.
With regerd to the form of the prononn ema, aa compared with
seia or εἰη, it may be remarlred that in the Runic inscriptions we
have eain, aaa, aaa, as well aa erit, (Dieterich, p. 289), and that
we have amin, aa well as atera, amia, etia, (Dieterich, p. 308).
lrecognize a form like carceri iu heczri, the other verb in this
inscription, which may obviously be connected with the Runic
hako or habea, “to hew or carve,” (above, p. 212), md thia
being so, it would be a surprising coincidence, if it were only a
coincidence, that these three lines should conteiu two cl the

verbs which appear in the same way in the Runic inscriptionsr
