fact that the purchaser finds his benefit in the transaction. A
recent theological writer has remarked that “ the verb emo,
which signifies literally ‘to select for use’ (whence amor and its
derivative am[a]o, cf. diligo), is employed in its compounds
proruo and sumo to denote the use made of the selected articles,
or of the money which is their representative; these must bc iu
prorupta before they ean be in sumptu, they must be κτηματα
before they can be χρήματα. Hence promptus is the primary
ss well as the secondary synonym of ἑτοῖμος.” When we re-
collect that the compounds rid-imo, erc-imo, iuter-imo, give us
the i ¹, which presumes an a in the wealrer form (as in con-ficio,
fromfeesb, dic, above, p. 309), we are entitled to suppose that ·
emo represents a primary amo, emh, and a secondaty ern-ah,-
(comp. ten-eo, eon-tineo, with τάω, raudo, doc). We shall see
in the next chapter that amor presumas an original aru-ior, aud
that am[a]o suggests a form aru-a = orn-yn which is included iu
, amor=am-ior‚ formed from the genitive case of such a noun.
It is usual to connect amor with the Senserit hama, which
corresponds to it in meaning. Bnt as the analysis now before us
shows that “ love” is a secondary meaning, derived from that of
“ selection‚” we may leave out of the question any results arising
from this immediate comperirem and as the Greek πρί-αμαι, πι-
πρά-σκω, are manifestly connected with the pronominal com·

α-νηια with ἅμα, namra, mom, which express union or conjunctim,
and hence appropriation (Nero Orat. ξ 181), end hringus ulti·
mately to the most probablc origin of the Senserit soma. It is
worth noticing that the Greek ἀ-σπάζομαι, “ Ι draw to myself‚’'
and ‹i-ownate “ au angler,” (cf. the proper name Ἀσφα-λίων
in Theocritus xxi), really include in this prefix this pronominal
combinabor, and the same is the case with une-plector and eom-
pfector. No difficulty will be created by the fact that we have

¹ It is to be remarlred that the omission of tha i in como, demo, memo,
proemium, cumo, is in accordancs with the Latin analogy‚ which often
requires the omission ef the initiali in the second member of a com-
ponnd, thus as mmo, &c stand for ocimo, dac, so we have copo, co-yito,
