The position of the article before μουνῶπα shows that the words
Ἀριμασπὸν ἱπποβάμονα ere to be taken in close connexion, and
apert from the epithet μουνῶπα ; and I see in this fragment of
symbolical mythology a traoe of that Hyperborean sun-worship,
which the Pelasgians brought from Media into Greece and Italy.
For Arimjocpas is most naturally explained as Abarim-appo, or
Orias-oppa, the “horse’' or “ horseman of light,'’ thus explain·
