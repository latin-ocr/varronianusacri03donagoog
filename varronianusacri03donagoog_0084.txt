“the light or life of the sun.” The second part of the word
at once refers us to the. Senserit sarpa, which is also implied in
the σύρων ὅρμα of AEschylus (Pers. 86; N. Orat. β 473). 'Phe

of the digamma, the sound of w at the beginning of a word was

often expressed by· o: thus wc have Ὀαξοοε trifon Ὀασις, ,

and the word οἶστρος, referring to the ιοίιιῑιαίιιρ noisc of the Ὺ

Persian ann-god was sometimes known by a part of this
Scythiae name, we might heled to ask whether the Persian
Mithrae had not a representative in Scythia. Now we read not
only that the Persians called the “ δαῖθ’ Mithrae (Strabo, p. 752:
τιμῶσι δὲ τὸν Ἥλιον, ὃν καλοῦσι Μίθραν), but also that the
Persians gave the name oi Mitra to the heavenly Venus (Herod.
1. 131: ἐπιμεμαθήκασι δὲ καὶ τῇ Οὐρανίῃ θύειν, παρά τε
Ἀσσυρίων μαθόντες καὶ Ἀραβίων. καλέουσι δὲ Ἀσσύριοι τὴν
’Ἀφροδίτην Μύλιττα, Ἀράβιοι δὲ Ἀλιττα, Πέρσαι δὲ Μίτραν).
From this it appears that the Persians had a pair· of deities
called Mithrae and Mithra, and that the latter corresponded to
the heavenly Venus. Bnt the very dualism itself shows that she
must have been a form of Artemr's, the sister-goddess of Apollo,
and therefore represented the moon. Thus J ul. Firmicus says (de
Μτ. Prof. Βιίιζρ. 1. c. 5: “hi itaque [Magi et Persae] Jovem in
duas dividant potestates, naturam ejus ad utriusque sexus trans·

tes.”' This pair of deities seems to he implisd in tho dual forms

(ρ. 351): “les deux seigneurs Mithras¹.'’ But the most important
