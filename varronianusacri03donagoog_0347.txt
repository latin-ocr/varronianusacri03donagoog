Tharais ss much probability in the supposition that the immor·
tal name oi Rome was derived from this ancient word, as there
is in any of the numerons etymologias suggested by Festus (p.
266). From this it appears, that among the Romans it was the
same thing to speak of a territory as divided by roads, and to
call it cultivated, occupied, or built upon3 and the japetum, or
divided aper, implied both. To the same principle we may refer
the importance attached by the ancients to straight ploughing¹;
for the furrow was the first clement of the road ς and the erbe
itself was only that space round which the plough had been for·
mally and solemnly drawn.

The Romans were very sparing in their use oi the Greek
letter x. It was occasionally employed to form the syllable ka,
as in kalumniae, kandidatua, kaput, Kartbaqo, Kaetor, avota-
tne, factitandae, Portarum ; bnt in these instanoes it was con-
sidered quite superfluous3 and Quintilian thinks (1. 4, 9, and t,
10) that its use ought to be restricted to those cases in which
it serves as the conventional mark of an abbrevation, as in K. =
Kaeso, and K. or Kal. :Kabadm Isidor (Oriyy. 1, 4) and
Petrus Diaconus (p. 1582, Putseh) tell us that the letter K was
added to the Roman alphabet by the tudtempbrer Sallustius,
in order to mark a distinction between x and Q. But ithae been
already mentioned that x was always o'ne oi the Roman letters,
and this must have been merely an attempt to bring it into
more general use. ·

The letter r was never used hythe Romans except as the
transcription of v in words derived either from or through the
Greek3 and it seems to have been a representative of those
sounds which have been designated above hythe characters n,
and U„ both ol' which involve an approximation to the sound of 1.
Hence, in the French alphabe‘t it is not improperly called “ the
Greek s'” (ί prae). In many words, rather connected with the
Greek than derived from it, the u is represented by 1, as in
