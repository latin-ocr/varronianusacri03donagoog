sense of “ property-dependent,” just as in English lew there ise
distinction of immediate or intermediete derivation between a
person who takes by limitem, and one who takes by porcinse,
i. e. from the person last seized. It may be doubted whether
“hear,'' hirco, and their unaspireted 'derivatives “een” olar,
may not be derived from this root, so thet lieren will signify
“to catch‚’' i. e. a sonnd. If so, heres, as implying dependente,
will approximate in origin end meaning to elato, “the hearers’
or hoerr'qer, according to Niebuhr’s etymology (H. R. 1. p. 323,
note 823). In the verbs hed-w and ten-eo the root-meaning is
seriously modified by the effix. For haheo rnnst correspond in
root to yslo, pafo, “give” and these, es Grimm hes shown
(Abi. Alc. Berlr'o, 1848), fall back upon χέω εχέῈω (cf. ὑφαίνω,
ὑφή with Ο. Η. G. wopa, wapr Ο. N. oef, aas, Sanscr. capr
Engl. “ weave‘’); end the form χιών, which shows a temnant of.
the f in its ι, is clearly connected with xiie (see Hom. Il. xrr.
281: ὥστε νιφάδες χιόνος πίπτουσι ...... κοιμήσας δ’ ἀνέμους
χέει deheim: similarly, we have χίλιοι from χιλός, “a heap
of fodder,'’ also connected with χέω (Nero Orat. ᾖ 163). Con-
sequently, the root had- must imply originally rather “to 'pour
out and give,'' than “ to heve’¹ or “ possess.” Similerly, tea-eo,
which contains the same root as read-o, “to stretch out,” end
ten-do, falls back upon the old epic imperative τῆ, “ take thou.''
Although the formative adjunct ya hes inverted the ideas of
giving end taking in hob-eo and ten-eo, we find thet they ere
only pertielly kept distinct in the former. Thus, while the root
tem, when strengthened hythe adjunet do, hes qnite e different
meaning from ten-eo, we find that haheo, in its compounds per-
tate, prroeheo ερνω-Ιιῶοο, quite reverts to the primitive meaning
os the root, for both these words imply e holding forth and
giving, ss though prebere meent pror se habere like proe referre
or pretendere. The same is the case with ἔχω (see Arnold on
Thucyd. 1. 9), and still more with παρέχω, whence comes the tech-
nieel use of παροχή, “ supplying,” “furnishing,” end the leter
