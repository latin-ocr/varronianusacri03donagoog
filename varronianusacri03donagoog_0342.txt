Oorssen, who has examinati· the vowel-changes 'at some

length, considers (1. p. 298) that eontignons eonsonants prodne'e

a regular series of changes in the neighbouring vowels, which he
representsjn the following table (p. 299):

a becomes o, ιι, a, ι’,
obeoomes ιι, e, ι’,
ιι becomes a, ι’,

e becomes ι’, ιι,

ι’ beoomes a.

And he gives the following as the general result of his investi·
gations (1. p. 323):

A sinks into ιι before the labiels b, p, v, m, before simple l,
and before land another consonant. t

A sinhs inte e in a closed syllable before two or more oonso·
nants and before ι.

sis weshened into ι’ before all simple masmanna„ exeept
those already specilied.

n often sinhs into ι’.

0 generally remains anchanged.

u is always immutable.

1, ss the thinnest and lightestwowel, is not eapable of any
further extenuation.

·(above‚ ξ 1), included in the oldest alphabet, derived by the
Romana from the Greeks of Cuma. But when o was formed
from c, z resigned its place to the former letter, and c super-
seded almost every use of n. On the other hand, nwae re-intro-
duoed before the death of Cicero, and an attempt was made by a
grammarian to inhabilitate ι( ίιι general nse. The letter r did
not appear in the oldest Roman alphabet‚ and was horrowed
during the literary epoch expressly for the purpose of writing an
equivalent to Τ in words transcribed from the Greek. We must
therefore remember with regard to these three letters that x,
although rarely used, was always to be found in the' Roman
