as the representative of the sibilante, and through them of the

gutturals, with some labial‚ just as fara, φήρ, and θήρ pre- Ι

sume the Russian eosdm now this combination is neither more
nor less than the f. which represents the second pronominal
element3 but the nonus of ageney in -tcr give us this second
elementia its dental degeneration, followed hythe same r as a
representative of the third element; therefore, the endings

, e÷ ὕ must be divergent representatives of the same

original f÷ r = f ÷ a, to which in point of fact they come quite
as near as t÷ r (above, p. 422).

The same analysis may be applied to the nouns in -c-tuaa,
-f-la, and -o-rr'am, as arbor-ecum, ov-f-lc, grand-rium,- for if
arboreus is formed hyan adjunot of the second clement under
the form yn, arbor-atam must extend the same form hyan
addition of the third clement, and a similar explanation will be
required hythe long t= a· and ἄεσα of oet-la and yrun-daim,
to which the land r terminatione are appended.

“ We see then that all nouns expressing agency, or the place,
means, and occasion cf ageney, are formed by adding a combi-
nation of the second and third pronominal elementa—and this
is what we should ὰ priora' expect—for the idea of agency is
that something, i. e. a doing, proceeds from the subject, who
hythe nature of the case is presumed to be near, and passas
en to an object, which hythe nature of the ease is presumed to
be relatively more distant. But we observe that the same sort
of endings are used to form ordinary adjectiwes derived from
noune and not from verbs ; thus from rex we have rapu-fd =
rep-ya-lcir, from Roma we have Rene-‹tamRmna-ydaruc, from
masal we have mmaddrch=coasalyoara from aiva we have
northwici-yades, from asinas we have caia-causariam-
πω, dcc, which fully correspond to the forms mla, yrun-daiam,
&c.; and there is also a class of diminutives in -ea-las, which
exhibit the same termination as the verbal noune offaculum, &a
. It will be easy to show that the combination of elementa
in these cases is as consistent with their primitive signification
as in the class previously examinsd. 'Po hegin with the dimi·
nutives. As there are objective nouns in -tam, -lmn, ήκω, es
