tilia. 51, p. 86) that “it is not likely that this vulgar contraction
would be admitted in heroic poetry ;‘’ and with regard to equi-
dem in particular, the instances which he hes cited of ita usage
in the first person plural, andin the other persons, are sufficient
to justify Priscian's repudiation of the common belief that it is a
corruption of φο qur'dem. It would be better, therefore, to sup-
pose that &quidem is related to quidem just as enim is to aem,
and that the first two syllables were pronounced distinctly iu
Virgil, Geor-q. 1. 415: laud equidem credo quio ait dfvfaftar
flfr‘a. Pers. 1. 110: lettera-per me equidem siat emath pro-
tinas aldo. Lucan, vl11. 824: baed eqetiiem immerito &manta
carmine ooth. As to the argument from qandoquidem, there
can be no doubt that praedo rnay be a trocheo (see the exemplos
quoted by Corssen, 1. p. 343), the first three syllables of quen·
doqoc'rfm necessarily constitute a dactyl in Lucretius 1. 587:
quid porro nequeat, mnodum quandoquidem eatan and in what·
ever manner we pronounce qadim the second syllable of quaa·
mquidem is certainly not long in Plautus, Tria. 352: wado-
qufdem nec tibi bene esee pdtc poti nee alteri. With regard to
siquidem there is no doubt that the d is pronouuced'in Ter.
Heaut. 11. 3, 90: quid eliud ati oth-atqeidem boc ffl—dqutdem
when a· retains its proper quantity and is prouounced separately.
And though siquidem may be a dissyllable in these passages in
the eomedians where it cannot be a cretio, it is not likely that it
was so prouounced in hexameter verse, especially when there is
an ecthlipsis, as in Juvenal vl. 6212 boletus—siquidem unfus
proeaordrh parit, which would reduce the particle to st'que.
And on the whole we may follow the analogy of qaaaddqrtdem,
and consider the first syllable of siquidm as shortcned in those
cases in which the two words formed a single particle, just as

Horace writes (1 Sem lx. 43)
Maceror quomodo tecam,

where be uses mornado as a mere particle3 though in thereme
satire (v. 48) he writes:
noa isto vicimus illio,
Quo te rere, modo,
where he uses qao and modo as two distinct words.
It is manifest that modo must often have been prouounced
