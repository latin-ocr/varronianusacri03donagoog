360 uucssssrors or rsa sarrs nourr. [enar. rx.

-ra's are the basis of further extensione iu -leaa and Aac, such
as auctaas, preto-raba, due, which in Greek would sometimes
appear as -λι-κος, and for this there is au occasional parallelis
Latin, asin firme-licus. The following classificatiou will show
how for the whole group of ι’ nouus has retained⁴ or lost the

’ original characteristic.

(o) The characteristic ι’ is retained iu the singular, as in
sitas, Tifiem's‚sebra's, pappos.

(b) The characteristic t'is omitted or changed into e in the
nom. sing, hut retained in the ahl, asin mare, animal, pal-
oc'nar, os (gen. ossis).

(c) The characteristic ι’ is omitted or changed into e in the
nom. sing.. and e always appears in the abl. sing, asin arba,
nubas, mera, pars, Arpinas, Quina

(d) The characteristic is absorbed by the contractiora ot' a-r'
into ὃ, which becomes a new characteristic, and is retained
throughout, asin dees for deit-rh.

As this last class of nouus never exhibite the original form

even in the gen. ph, and as it coincides· in inflexione with the a
deelension, of which it is an extensior, it might be convenient
on some accounts to place it next to the noune in a. We should
then have representatives of the three primary rowels o, c, o,
and as the original r of the genitive plural is not omitted except
between two short vowels, these vowel-nouus would have this
consistent distinction from all the others, while the dat. and abl.
dietas would be paralleled by the oceasional forms deabus, and
the gen. dt'et', diac would stand by the side of occasional forms
like aquai, familias. These resemblances between the first and
fifth declcnsions- of the ordinary gammara have induoed Bopp
(Vcrpl. Gramm. p. 141 sqq.) to identify these forms of the Latin
noun, on the assumption that the d of the first declensiou was ori·
ginally ᾶ, aud that the difference, for example, between amana
and masaia* is simply that between the lonic η and the Doric ᾶ.
Το the obvious objection that the nom. sing. of the ἓ nouus in-
variably exhibite a final s, which is always wanting in the a
· nouus, not only in Latin, but in Senserit, Zend,· Greek, Gothic,
and Lithuaniau, Bopp replies hy 'asserting that spectes and caai-
tr'es are linguistic patriarche, exhibiting a more original form of
