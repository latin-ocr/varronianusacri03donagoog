posiu‘oas.
· On the whole, it must be mnfessed that the Indu sub-
“ junctive, meaning by that term the set of tenses which are
formed hythe insertion of 42, differs modally from the indicative
only in this, that it is uniformly employed in dependent clauses
where the idiom of the language repudiatas the indicative3 and
it is not a little remarkable tbat in alm0st all these cases-in
all, except wben final partiales are used, or when an indirect
question follows a past tense—the indicative is expressly required .

adjective in concord with the object. There are also three forms
of the participle: (a) one in -es = -rtts, sometimes lengthened into
-ndua ,⁰ (β) another in -tus,· and a third (y) in -tcirrm 'the parti-

· ciple ia -ns is always active; its by-form in edus is properly
active, though it often seems to be passive. The participle in
-tus is always passive, except when derived from a deponent
verb, in which case it corresponda in meaning to the Greek
