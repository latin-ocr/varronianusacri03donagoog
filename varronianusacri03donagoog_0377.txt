in -n'- indicated hy the genitive supellectile, and the :c does not
represent s p but ets. The same is the case with omer, which
conversely exhibite a shertened form in its genitive acob· cf,
however, emeatus, senece, ammae, dre. The root ef see-ee is te
be sought in the Senserit send, and the old Saxen and Η. Gi
ain, “ always,” found also in the Gothic 'sit-eine and we have
the same root in acm-per, opposed te nuper, as sen-ee to noem
(belew, Ch. x. § 6). The idea ol sen-ea is that ef advaneed
longevity rather than that of relative age, which is expressed by
neajor, mammes, with er without netu ; and similarly minor, mini-
mres, is used instead ef junior. In Persius wc find Aristophanes
designated as praepandit senec (1.124), and as Cratinus is men·
tioned in the same passage, the epithet munet refer to the great
. age el the other poet, but must mean that he was the mest illus·
triens representative ef theold comedy (comedeia proice Hor. 1.
aem. 1v. 2; comoedeia oetas, id. Ara Poet. 281). The substantive
aeciam is often used te denote antiquity in general, as in Statius
' Sile. 1. 3, 38: venerabile lucorum senium. Ihare intimated the
possibility (above, p. 203) that in old Etnisean ctera, which seems
ta denote “ an elder son,’' may be connected with cetea. But there
isne authority lor this use of the word in Latin. With a geni·
tivo caua may signily experienced (pucras), as in Silius, nn·
332: quares belli maresque iaderam, and this is common enough
in Tacitus, as in Annei. vnce: ectus reprendi. It might be
supposed that this is the meaning of veterrimum liberorum in
i’1. 31, which cannot signity “the eldest ol his sons.'’' But the
absence of the genitive, and the whole context, induce me
to suppose that the text is corrupt, and that we ought to read
meeum instead of oetenirnutn. The werd odeas occurs im-
mcdiately alter; and the sevitie of the father would lead us to
expect an epithet which would signify “mest tyrannical;” et‘.

be compared with cteo=pviqvo, struo =etruquo, dee. The gen.

that these neuns really belong to the I deciension. The tenuis
