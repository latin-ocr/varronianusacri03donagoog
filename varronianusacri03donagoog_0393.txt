genitive stands hythe side of the possessive. Thus we may say
not only mcc compto, “my writings,'' sor “ the svritings of me‚”
but even mea serapte recitare timeatr'c (Hor. 1. serm. 4, 23),
“the writings of mc feering to recite;’' and not only ἡμετέρα
ἔρις, “our contention,” for “the contentiori ol us‚” but even
'assoon ἔρις ἡμετέρα (AEschyl. Eum. 975), “the conention of
us good persons.” We see then how easy the transition moy be
from such phrases ss mcc unius spaera respublica ert calm, or
cestris pauonum rependet medina, to eom errius tcr‘ studeo
mc omequa' posse confido, or omlnes omnium voluntati parcit.
Hence we find that ultimately mei sud tus‘ were the only geni·
tives of epo and tc, and nostri mnostrum, ondoectrioroestrum,
the only genitivos of nos and voc. The same remark applies to
the very defective pronoun of the third person, the reciprocal se,
which has lost its nominative, and has only the genitive sci, the
dative ati, and the accusative or ablativone, for all genders and
numbers. We must also consider the Greek ἐμοῦ, or poi,
anciently μεοῦ (N. Orat. ξ 134), and σοῦ, as properly belonging
to the possessive. The hypothesis ofan attraction, which I have
proposed, is the only way of explaining the differenoe in the
usage of nostri, noscam, and of cerm, sermm. Thst nostrum,
oestrum erc genitivos plural, is clear from the fect that they were
anciently used in the lull forms aaronem, omtrorcmr thus in

Plautus (Mostell. 1. 3, 123) we have: oerwm illud est, maximae ,

poraoostroromr‘ntellipit. As genitivos theycenonlybeexplained
by an attractiou into the case of some plural genitive expresscd
or understood. In general, we do not find the genitive except
when the personality is emphatically expressed3 aa in Ovid,
Herodi. 1111. 166: si 'teht' oure ones· ait ati carc tui. cic.
Oarit lv. 9: lebetae decem ‚numerent vestri, oblitum cui. ,
And ‘herc it may stsnd hy thc side os an inflected possessive, ns
in cie. ad Fam. ΧΗ. 172 proto mitt· vehemeter est meamne
nostri tear or even be opposed -to one, as in ovid, Heroid.
vn. 134: parsque militent corpore clausa meo. But whereas
noret, vestri, are used only when we speak of the persons as a
„ whole; aa: memorio nostri tua, “your recollection of us,'’ as a
single object of thought3 nostram, vetram are employed when
we spesln of the persons ss a collection of separate or separable
clemente. Accordingly, the latter is the form adopted after such

rav. 24
