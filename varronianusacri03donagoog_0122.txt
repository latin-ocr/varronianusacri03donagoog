The explanation of this abundanee ol written characters is to be
sought in the admitted lact thet the old inhabitants of Italy derived
their alphabet from the Greek colonists, and not immediately from
the Phoenicians. This isproved hythe circumstance, that the
Italian alphabeta eontain from the first the letters v, ξ, φ, χ, which

were invented or introduced with a new application by the ,ς
exesis. weh ne exception orne mern, sn ee larun apes- ·
bets originated inan old form ol the Greek alphabet, which still i
retained both σάν end alyne, and, on the contrary, had lost the

educo-(see N. Orat. 5102). To this class belong the Sabellian
und Etrurian alphabeta, and with slight deviations we have this
collection of characters in the Etrurian of Campania, in the
Umbrica, end in the Oscan (see Mommsen Unteritol. Diat pp.
4-7, 14, 243 Nordener. Alphahate, pp. 222-227). But be·
sides this Greek alphabet, which must have been borrowed from
the Hellenic settlers at a very early period, there was another
and more recent set of Greek characters, which the Roman de·
rived lrom the Dorio alphabet of the Greeks of Cuma, probably
under the deminution of the Tarquins, when there were special
relations between between Ourna and Rome (see Mliller‚ Etruria
11. 312 3 Mommsen, Uetero'tel. Del. pp. 3, 9, 26. Nordctrnr. Al·

twenty-four letters ; but θ, φ, andx fell into disuse at a very
early period3 for η was not used as along vowel but as the
aspirate h, and the combinatione th, ph, ob took the places of the
single letters invented by the Greeks. For sometime c repre-

characters cando were introduced, as we shall see ln a future
chapter, hythe freedman Sp. Carvilius3 and classieal Latinity
was contented with these twenty-three letters: a, b, c, 9, d, c, fib,
i, k, l, m, n, o, p, p, r, a, t, c (v), ro, y, a, which with the exception
of the guttural o, modified ashes been mentioned, the super·
numerary use ol v under the form y, and the omission ol the
Greek θ, φ, χ, correspond to the Dorio alphabet of the Tarquins

Il we compare the Italion alphabeta with the oldest form of
the Greek, we shall remark that, notwithstanding the omission
