aud Heorta implya warrior-tribe, distinguished by their sudden
onset and rapid career¹. similarly, an Homeris hero is wihus p
daris, predaoeous animals are θῶες, and the Scandinavian pirates ¹
have leit the cagle or the war-galley on the armorial bearings
of those familias which claim a descent from them, as an indi- }
cation of the same characteristic. This would be admitted asa ³
reasonable conjecture even if it had nothing else to recommcnd
it However‚ it does so happen that we have a distinct record
of a migratory conquest by the Scandinavians in the heart ol
Europe rather before the colonisation of Iceland, in which they ¹
called themselves by the same name as these Roseae or Het· p
rue-i. It hasbeen shown by Zeuss (da Dastarkon, pp. 547, sqq.) ³
that the language oi these conquerere, who descendcd the Dnieper, l
¹the Volga, and the Dou, was Old Norae, and that their leader
Gbocaa bears the Norse name Heluam and Symeon Magister, l
who wrote A. ι). 1140, has given the same Scandinavian explu-
nation of their name Ros, which I have suggested for Rus-cam l
for he says (demptos post Themakos. ed. Paris, p. 490): οἱ Par i
siml Δρομῖται λεγόμενοι, “ the Ruswho are called the raccrsor ἐ
’ mnners;‘' and (p. 465): ‘Pae δὲ οἱ Δρομΐται φερώνυμοι-δρο- ¹
μῖται δὴ dadraei ὀξέως τρέχειν αὐτοῖς προσενγένετοι “the Ros arc
called the rnnners, and they are so called from the rapidity of
their motion’.‘’ Here the conjecture, which I proposed to the
British Association, is confirmed by an authority subsequently · ¹
observed: arduo one will deuy tho obvious value of this cor·
roboration. That the name Bosana or Ros, thus explained,
would be a very suitable designation lor a dominant tribe of
warriors is shown by the fact that the highest class at Rome
had no older name than that of celeres or “swift-horsemen.”

There can be little doubt that the word roas, which appears also
