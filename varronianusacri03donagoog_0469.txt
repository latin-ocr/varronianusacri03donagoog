pound ol ad aud oro, just as alloqui is a compound of ad and
‘ loqui,· and we know (from Festus, pp. 19, 182), that orator was
originally a name for an ambassador, and that adorare meant
η opere caussae So that oro means to make en oratio or speech,
and emphatically to use the oe or mouth lor the pmposc of ob·
taining something. Hence, it pasees into its meaning “to ask”
or “ pray for,” and theu becomes nearly synonymous with pharo
aud imploro. But if oro comes from oe, why should not pl-oro
hare the same origin? There ean be no difficulty about the first
two letters, which contain the root of pal-ua, plerique, πλ-έος,
aona, “full;” and the phrases pleno ore laudare (Cic. de
Officia, 1. 18), and plena rore vocare (Verg. Georq. 1. 388), are
sufficient to show how pl-oro got its original and proper meaning
“to cry aloud.’' Now ‘¹ to call aloud‘' sor anything is to desire
it eamestly and to demand it with importunity3 hence in Greek
wc have such phrases as βοᾷ necyia Ἐρινύς (AEsch. Ohocph.
396), which is equivalent to Shakspere’s “they say it will bave
blood.'' And iu general the idea of esking, which is involved
in the etymological analysis of prmo (above, p. 419), passesinto
that of secking, which is sochen and so regularly convcyed by
that verb aud its compounds. As then exquiro has lost all
traoe of the original meaning of qaoeso=qeoero, “I cause to
speuk‚'’ so exploro has quite taken leave of the sense of “calling
cloud” originally borne by pluro, and means merely “to seek
out,” so that it is perfectly synonymcus with aquiro. In a
passage oi Virgil (Georp. 1. 175) we find ceptor-o used of the
searching nature of smoke‚ which penetrates the smallest uper·
tures, aud insinuatas itself into the tissne of a substance: “et
suspensa locis aptarat robora firmus.” The force ol the prepo-
sition in exploro is merely intensive, as in car-quire. It has not
that sense of effecting and obtaining which we notice in sucro, as
in Ter. Andr. 111. «1, 13: “gnatam ut det oro, vixque id ecoro:”
and Hecyra, Ptol. 2, v. l: “orator ad vos venio ornatu prologi:
sinite aanor sim.” In deploro we sometimes have the same
use of the preposition which we notice in tle-sidero, and ‹Ic-spero,
aud de expresses a feeling of loss or absence. With regard to
de-as'dm it may be remarked in passing, that, as comtemplor and
coa-asidera are augurial terms derived from the observation of the
heavenly templum and its stans, so ‹lc-sidero indicates the inter-
