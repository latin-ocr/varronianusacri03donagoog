Umbriam, but also by the resemblances of the Sabine and
Umbrian languagee1. It is true that this last remark may be
made also with regard to the Sabine and Osoau idioms; for
many words which are quoted as Sabine are likewise Oscan¹.
The most plausible theory is, that the Sabinas were Umbrians,
who were separated from the rest os their nation, and driven
into the high Apennines‚ by the Pelasgians of the north-eaet3
but that, aster au interval, they in their turn assumed an
offensivc position, aud descending from their highlands, under
the name of Sabini, or “worshippers oi Sabus the son of
Sancus³,” attooked their Umbrian brothton on the one eide, and
the Oscan Latina on the other. At length, however, ibey sent
out so many colonica to the south, among the Osoan natione, that
their Umbrian affinities were almost forgotten3 and the Sabellian
tribes, especially the Samnites, were regarded as members of the
· Oscan family, from having adopted to a considerable extent the
language of the conquered tribes among whom they dwelt

been Safini or saraae, “the mered? According to this, the name Sabini
