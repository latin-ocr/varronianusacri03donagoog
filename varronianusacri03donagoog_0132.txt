however, no one who has done more to prepare the way for a
scienfitic examinatior of these Umbrian documenta than lapsine,
who examined all the preliminary questions connected with the
subject in an inaugural dissertation published in 18331, and who
has subsequently edited a most accurate collection of facsimiles,
which appeared in 1841 ¹. The materiale furnished by Lepsins
have been elaborately discussed in a special work by Anfrecht
and Kirchhotf, published in 1849⁸3 and though their treatise

is defective in arrangement and inconvenient for purposes of

- reference, it deserves the praise of never attempting too much,

and itis generally distinguished by a careful regard for the
principles of sound philology. The most recent work on the
Eugubine tables is that of E. Huschke, which has J'nst app'eared4.
This scholar has undertaken to give a complete explanation of
the Umbrian inscriptions, and has, in consequence, been obliged
to resort to a considerable number of arbitrary conjectures, in
which he sometimes rohes too much on Greek assonances. It
must, however, be allowed that he has advanced our knowledge
of the subject in regard to many of the details. ’

transcripta of [epsins⁶, and the anarrgement of the Tables is
that which he has adopted. The first fonr Tables, and part of

the fifth, are written ¹in the Etruscan or Umbrian character. 3
