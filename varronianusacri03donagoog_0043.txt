fied by the ancient writers with the singular and unaffiliated
nation of the Etruscam. Το determine the origin of this people
and the nature of their languagc has been considered for many
years as the most difficult problem in Philology. And while
Bonarota, in hie supplement to Dempster², earnestly exhorta
the learned, and especially orientalists, to labour at the discovery
of this lost language, suggesting the hope of ultimate success,

· if a carefully edited collection of inscriptionscan be procured to ,

fumisb materials for the worlr, Niebuhr remarks, in his lecturas
on Ancieut Geography¹: ‘⁴ People feel an extraordinary curiosity
to discover the Etruscan langnage; and who would not enter·
tain this sentiment? I would give a considerable part of my
worldly means as a prise, if it were discovered; for an entirely
new light would then be spread over the ethnography of ancient
Italy. But however desirable it may bc, it does not follow
that the thing is attainable.” ,And he proceeds to point out the
inherent faultiness of some previous investigatione. Whatever
may be the value of the discovery, I cannot ¹allow myself to
doubt that' the true theory is that which Ι have had the honour
of submitting to the British Association⁸. It has always ap·
peared to me every great reproach to modern philology that
while we cau read the hieroglyphic literature of Egypt, and
interpret the cuneiform inscriptions of Persia and Assyria, 'we
should profess ourselves unable to deal scientificslly with the
remeius of a language which flourished in the midst of Roman

skill in cochem, dre, remind one very much ef the united racc οἱ nsua
and Toltecs which Oenea found iu Mesico.
