parochus, “ a purveyor” (Hor. 1. Sem. 5, 43), or “entertainer''
(id. ibid. 11. 8, 36). This technical sense of παρέχω has been
overlooked in Thucyd. lv. 39: βρώματα ἐγκατελήφθη· ὁγὰρ
ἅρχων Ἐπιτάδας ἐνδεεστέρως παρεῖχεν ἢ πρὸς τὴν ἐξουσίαν.
. When liabeo denotas astate or condition it generally takes the
reflexive pronoun ae, where the Greek uses ἔχω absolutely with

an adverb in -ως; but Sallust (Cot. 6) bas: “sicuti pleraque ¹

mortalium bobentur'' for ae babent. Metaphysical considerations

(Now Orat. ξ 53) might lead us to infer that liabeo not only
includes the ideas of holding forth or giving, and of having or
lueeping, but also conveys the antecedent notion of desiring

nuder the form oceo or dauco, which falls back on the Semitic ¹

:ujus or mil· But whatever reason we may have for eoriueeting
tabeo or tanao with this Hebrew root, there are two verbs in

-αο, which strongly support the ethnographieal theory respecting 5
the Sclavonism of the old Italicos, and their consequent Semitic ,

affinities. These are deb-eo, of which I have spoken above
(p. 91), and miae-eo. The latter, which appears with a medial
aualout in the Greek μίσγω, is represented under both forms by

the Hebrew ¹:100 and utu (found m the noun utu“mixed'w1ne’‘;)

From the extreme autiquity and universal prevalence of this
compound root, and from the formative affix with which it
⁵ appears as a verb in most ol the Indo-Germanic languages, it is
fair to conclude that its origin is to be sought in a pronominal
combination aualogous in meaning and form to the Irish enemy,
“ among‚'‘ “betweeu,’' Welsh ym-mualr, Greek με-τά, με’-σφα,
pre-xpc, μέσσος, Lat. ana-diuo, Hebrew illm, which would ¹
serve as a sufficient basis for such a causative verb. It has been
mentioned above (p. 91), in ageneral way, that ded-eo is eon-
nected with the important Semitic and Sclavenic root 27¹0,
duob, and dot, signifying “ good.'’ But it will be necessary in
this place to justify this comparisen with special reference to
the formative syllable of the conjugation. In its impersonal use,

oportet corresponds to the personal and impersonal use of debeo,
and as the former is clearly connected with opas, so tlte latter
