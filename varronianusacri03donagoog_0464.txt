ΤΗΕΒΕ ie not much difficulty in seeing that the Latin conju-
gatione ought ιο be arranged on the same principle as the
declensions-namely, according to the characteristic letters os the
different verbs. This mode of classifioation will give us three
conjugatione ol verbs in a, e, ι’, which are regularly connected,
and one conjugation of consonant verbs, which retain their
inflexione uncontracted, whether the characteristic is mute, liquid,
tr semi-consonant. In the first three conjugatione, which con·
tain none but derivative verbe, the crude form of a noun is made

the vehicle of verbal inflexione by means of the formative nffix yn, ¹

which belongs to the second pronominal clement. We shall see
that, while the o and ι’ conjugatione append this formative syl-

lable to crude forms terminating in these vowels respectively, the

c conjugation represents the pronominal affix by this vowel alone,
because it generally consiste of verbs formed from consonantal

noune. In the semi-consonantel forms, there is no difficulty in ι

seeing that the a verbs belong to the fourth and not to the vowel

conjugations3 but in order to know when a verb in -ι’ is to be Ἴ

considered as belonging to the vowel conjugation, and when, on

the other hand, it is ιο be counted as osani-consonantal verb, ,
we must observa the evidences of contractiori which are fumished ¹

in the former case hythe second person singular of the present

indicative, and by the present infinitiva. Thus, while audi-o l

gives us auen = andi-ab, audi-re weda-ere, and andi-rh
andi-eri, capio gives us cap-ia, cap-dra, and copi. Bcsides
this, as we have already seen (above, Oh. Χι. § 8), the vowel-
verb ie generally confined to an agglutinate perfect in -oi
