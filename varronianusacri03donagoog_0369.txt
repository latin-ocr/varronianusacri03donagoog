etiarn, and bears the same relation to piam that ἰάλλω does to
φιάλλω (Now Oratplaa § 110). Nam, 31 which enim 13 merely a
lengthened 1333, contains the same pronominal root as ἀ-νά, vai,
noe, 3333, dre. Id-eo (comp. 331-33) 13 equivalent to the Greek
ἐπίτηδες (= ert τάδεσιν, Buttmann), and from it is derived
31133333 = 3113333333 = Gr. ἐπιτήδειος. The form 31 tamen has
created some difficulty. Max. Schmidt (de proruam (13311333.
p. 91) considers that tam-ec is for tam-im and Pott (Etym.
Forach. 11. p. 136) regards the last syllable 31 tam-e'n as a
weakened 1333131333. As we hare both tam-quam arrd qaam·
pacm, and aa tarn-ca is the correlative 31 the latter, itis most
reasonable to suppose that the second syllable en is a locative
31 the pronoun ia, like im in iata-im. For tam, which appears
both in tam-en and tan-dem, we find tarne (Fest. p. 360), as we
have came t'or cam (Terent. Scaur. p. 226); and tam 13 substi-
tuted for tamenin tam-etei.

Some adrerbs are merely cases 31 common 33333, which
usage has made indeclinable. These appear sometimes aa con·
jmrctions, and sometimes as propositione. Ineter, 933113, and
erpo, may be compared with δίκην, χάριν, and ἕνεκα (see Nero
Orar.§§271sqq.). Prrpchl] (ef. propin-qaue) is the ablativa
31 33 old adjective, and prop-ter is its ease in amantea
Peraea and 33333 are forma 31 the same kind as icatur, and con·
tain the roots 31 pen-dere, tea-dere. Clam and ι331333 are loea-

tives 31 the same nature aa partim, &a The former, which waa
⁰ 3133 written colim (Fest. p. 47), contains the root 313313, κλέπτω,
matare, dre. Pahrm is the same case 31 33 adjective connected
with palaream, πύλη, dre. That it is a noun appears farther from
the fact, that it is used also with the preposition ia (ia palam =
aperte, Gloee. 13131), like ira-caream comp. pro-palam. The
same 13 the case with coram = oo'oram (κατ’ ὅμμ3); comp.
oo'mr'arra, e’mr'aua (ἐκ χειρός); illico ia ia beor and we have
eatemphr or eaterapalo from another form 31 tempus. Some·
times the adverb 13 merely the crude form 31 the noun. We
bare examples 31 this 13 simul, procul (from 31331131, proeilb);
more 13 supposed to be a corruption 31 moveam and the ancienta
wrote sacal (Fert. p. 87) and perfacul (id. p. 214) for faenlcer
or facile, and pafacrle. Again, the full form 31 the noun 13
occasionally used aa an adverb: in the xn. Tables we have
