plantation applies to post-illd: post-allec. 'Phe strongest oonfirm-
ation ol this view is fumished by the feet that no other proba-
ble explanation has been offered. For the only suggestion, which
merite a moment‘s attention-nemely, thet the long o ¹may be
occasioned by the absorption of the d which is still seen in ar-
oorsum eud, dvc„ selle to the ground when we consider thet the
neuter plural must always heve termineted in a double dentel, or·
the combination -nt, which is uniformly represented by e short
d, so that thed is elided and not obsorbed (Nero Crat. ξ 239).
The supposition (above, p. 145), that posted is lor portenta, on
the enalogy ofpostquom, dvc, is undeserving of any notice except
as a specimen of philological imbecility. As I heve elsewhere
remarked (Nero Orat, ξ 240, note): “every Latin scholar is
swere that quom is not here a ease after post, dre, but the par-

ticle of compsrison, so that the lull form, is, in lect, poet-ee-quom, ,

&c.¹'' And the ease of qudrsa‘ ior quom-si (for we have quan-sei
in the lec lhorio, above, p. 281, l. 34) shows thet qnam would
nothe represented by qo'·.

§ 5. Relative, Intempestive, aad Indefinite Pronouna

In ite syntecticnl nse, the relative connects with the indica-
tive or distinctive pronouns‚ end especially with ie, its regular
antecedent or correlative, some fuller description ol the person or
thing indicated. And thus, whether the antecedent is definite or

vagus, the relative sentence existe only by virtue ol its correlo· ·

tive; consequently, itis a syntectical contrivence which plays
the same pert es the adjective or genitive csse. Etymology
fully confirms this view ol the matter, which is derived from the
logie of the sentence, and without any reference to the forms of
words: for we see thet the correlative pronouns, air and qai, ore
manifestly identicel with one another, end with the effix of the
genitive case, which forms the basis of the possessive adjective

¹ When tho onthor ot' this ebenrd etymology says that “the other
word quo owed its length possibly to the circumstance of its being a
monosyllsble, just es ais ‘force' has a long l, navia, dvc. a short r'‚” I con
only suppose thet he does not know the differenoe between a crude form
in ·r like ois=oir-s‚ ph err-se, vir-inm, end one in ·t liko novt-s, pl. moos,
nomana
