(l Curru. 111. 28): synam frauda nata partebus intulit, when be
is speaking of the κακὴ τέχνη of Prometheus. In the old fecial
formulary preserved'by Livy (1. 24), we see the word iu its
genuine'and ancient signification: quod aina fraude mco populi-
que R. Q. fiat, facab, “I appoint you, and may it be without

. any hurt to me or the Roman aud Sabine people.‘'

All these exemplos refer only to nouus, whether substrmtives
or adjectivae, and adverbs, considered as cases of nouus. Strictly
speaking there are no synthetic or organic compounds of verbs3
those, which bave a proposition or adverb by way of prolix, are
merely parathetio combinatione, and, with the exception of au
occasional assimilation‚ the two parts of the word are not really
fused into one, and a trneois or separation is still possible. When
a verb contains two or more distinct roots, so melted down into .
one whole as to be incapable oi divulsion, we also find that the
verbis aderivation from some compound noun. Thus while
bene-yboio, mala-dieo, compono, malope, and the like, are shown
by the unaltered conjugation of the verb to be mere juxta-
positions of separable elemento, laeti-fic[a]o, belli-yer[a]o are
manifeatly not merely parathetic combinatione of aaran facio
and bellam pero, but verbs derived from the adjectives letificas,
belli-per, probably through a noun of action in ·c=pa. As
verb'als in -ua, like beneficus, laetificus, meleduno, dre. are equi-
valentin meaning to the present participles of the parathetic
verbs which they represent, and as their comparativae are ac-
· tually formed from the participles (e. g. maledicus, maledicentrbr),
we may conclude that the‘termination is the mutilated form of
some pronominal affix, like that of the Greek participles in ·oie=

vae or oia (Now Orat. 5414).
As far as the form of the compound is consented, it ia only

necessary to remark that when the second part begins, and the
crude form of the preceding word ends, with a vowel, an elision
takes place, as in mapn’cm'mua. It' the second word begins with
a consonant, and the first is au inflected word, the vowel of the
crude form is regularly changed into i,- thus a becomes iin
muri-dicus, tubi-cea, stelligaoe o becomes a· in amplificus, cari·
fea, fati-dabam α becomes i in arci-tenone, corni-per, lacti-ficar,⁸
