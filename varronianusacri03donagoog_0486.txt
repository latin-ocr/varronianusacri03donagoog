there are deviatione from perfect uniformity even in those oon·
jugatinus which we take as the type of the Latin verb; and
it is only in consequence of an excess in the degree of deviation
that we are indnoed to place the verbs with a consonantal ac-
oration in a class by themselves. The additions, by which the
present is strengthened in these verbs, are the liquid rr, which
in a solitary instance appears also as lt, and the combination sc..
The former of these adjuncts may or may not be the same with
the inserted anascdra, which we find in jaspe, root jay, farayor
root fiaya It is possible that such a nasal may have resulted
from euphony3 on the other hand, the manner, in which the‘
adjuncta -νι, -νυ are melted down so as to combine themselves
with the root, e. g. in φαίνω = pd-vyro (root φα), ἐλαύνω = ἔλσ-
afar, (root ἔλα), rendere it possible that the addition may be
pronominal or formative. And this view is confirmed by the
fact (notioed above, p. 455), that the inserted nasal seems, like
the added a, to be inconsistent with reduplication (cf. rnen-po,
rapi, dre). We do not find, in Latin as in Greek, that the
adjunot n coexists with the inserted a, asin τυ-γ-χά-νω, λσ-μ-
βά-νω, dra, or with the appended ec, as in ‹learned-vo, dcc.
Many of the Latin forms in a have corresponding verbs in Greek3
thus we have ear-ao by the side of κρίνω εκρί-νῃω, σφα-σω
(cf. nepe-nor) by the side of πέρ-νημι, ster-ao by the side of
στορέ-ννυμι, and tem-no by the side of τέμ-να). With regard
' to tem-no and epm-nc, which are nearly synonymous in Latin,
we know from the word temp-lam, referring to the actual di-
visions of a field or the imaginary regions of the sky (τέμενος),
and from tempas referring to the divisione of time (cf. καιρός
from nefpn‚.which is equivalent to μέτρανε see note on Pind,
Ol. rx. 38¹), that the primary meaning of the root tem· in Latin

¹To what is there said 1 may add that the Hebron f? , which the

LXX. translate καιρός, isderived from Υἲῖξ, cad-crs, “ to eut ;’' that in

English we speak ot* the “ nick'' of time, i. e. cf a small portion cut σῆς
that tempero means “ to put in a proper proportion ;'’ and that Hesiod
says (0. et D. 692): μίτρα φυλάσσεσθαι, καιρὸς θ’ s'rrl πᾶσιν ἄριστος.
(See Now cratylus, t 171.) lt is tobe obserred that tempora ‘⁶ tho temples
of tho bead,” are so called from tha separation of the zygornatlc arch
which connects the molar with the ternpore! bones at the ears.
