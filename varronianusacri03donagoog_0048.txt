, as there were capital cities in the mother-country; and these
occupied the whole tenitory beyond the Po, es far as the Alps¹‚

except th'e corner of the Veneti, who dwell round the extreme
point of the Hadriatic. There is no doubt that the Alpine
natione, especially the Raeti, have the same origin, but these
heve lost their civilisation from their elimate and locality, so as
to retain nothing of their original type except their spoken ι
language, and not even that without connption.” 'l'his distinet l

and positive statement is repeated by Pliny, who says (H. N, 111. 1

20, §133)= “people think that the Raeti were a branch oi the

Tuscan stock, driven out by the Gaulo under the leadership of

Raettrs'' (Raetos Tuscorum prolem arbitrantur, a Gallie pulsos
duce Raeto); and by Justin, who remarks (xx. 5): “the Tus·

cans also, under the leadership of Rectus, having lost their ances-
tral settlernents, occupied the Alps, and founded the tribes of ι

the Raeti, called aster their leader” (Tusci quoque, duce Rem,
avitis sedibus amissis, Alpes occupavere et ex nornine ducis gen·
tes Raetorum condiderunt) ; and it is confirmed by relies of art,
'names of places, and peculiarities oi language in the Tyrol (see '
the exemplos collected by Ludwig Steub in his essay ather die
&bethehem Rdtt'em aad ihren Zraeammendonp mit den Etmkcm,
Miinchen, 1843), to which the Raetiane of Lombardy were driven

by the Gauls, and from which they hed descended in the first in- ¹

stance. Strabo implies an adhesion to the same tradition, when
he says (1v. 6, p. 204): “above Gomon, built at the foot of the
Alps, lie on the one side the Raeti and the Vonones towards the
east, and on the other side the Lepontii, Tridentini, Steni, and
several other little trihes3 and these occupied Italy in former
times” (ὑπέρκεινται δὲ τοῦ Kainon πρὸς τῇ ῥίζῃ τῶν Ἀλπέων
ἱδρύμενον τῇ μὲν ‘Petrei καὶ Οὐένονες ἐπὶ τὴν ἕω κεκλιμένοι· τῇ
δὲ Ληπόντιοι καὶ Τριδεντῖνοι καὶ Στόνοι καὶ ἄλλα πλείω μικρὰ
ἔθνη κατέχοντο τὴν Ἰταλίαν ἐν τοῖς πρόσθεν χρόνοις). More-
over, Stephanus of Byzantium defines the Rari as a Tyrrheniam
that is, in his sense, as an Etruscan raee (Ῥοιτοί, Τυῤῥηνικὸν
ἔθνος), and it is quite in accordenee with the laws ot' language to

. suppose that Ῥοιτοί and Ῥασένο are only modificatione of the
