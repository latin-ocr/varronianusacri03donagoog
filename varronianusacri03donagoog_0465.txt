There are indeed irregularities‚ which must be learned by expe· ·
rience, and which generally flow from the copartnership iu dif-
ferent tenses of two distinct verbs, as when pato, petere havea
perfect and participle petivi and peterere, from a lost verb in -a'o,
or when capio, cupivi, cupitus, have an infinitive carpere, as
though the iwere a semiconsonantal adjunct. But the general
distinctions of conjugations are those which dicriminate the
dcclensions of nouns. ’

In laying down the general rules for the conjugation of
a Latin verb, the grammarian has to consider, in the first
instance, whether the perfect indicative (A. ΙΙΙ.), or the passive
participle (Ε. ΙΙΙ.), present any deviation from the form of the
verb3 and he must then inquire what is the cause of this ·
irregularity. Now, as we have seen in the previous chapter, the
Latin verb has three forms of A. III.: (a) the proper or redupli-
cated perfect; (β) the aorist perfect in -ee',· (γ) the composite,
or agglutinato, perfect iu -oa' or -ae', from fui. According to the
general rule already given, the vowel-verb is properly limited to
the third form of the perfect active. In point of fact, there are
only two exceptione to this rule in the case of the -a verb, aud
these two exceptione give us the regular or reduplicated perfect.
But the two verbs, in which this form is found, araboth of thern
irregular. For do, which makes A. III. dadi, D. I. dd‘re, and
E. III. delata does not fully and properly belong to the vowel-
verbs‚ but partly also to the same class as its compounds ooo-do,
corr-deb, coa-didi, madore, coa-dtas. 'It is true that we have
dm for the second person singular of A. I., and that the common
forrn of O. I. is dam, dee, det, &c.; but daim is the old forru of
the latter3 and the quantity of a in dabam deiram, shows that

we have not to do with a verb of which the characteristic is a, -

but with one which preserves this form of its root, or articulation,
vowel. The old du-c'm, compared with the Umbrian, Oscan, and
Tusean aa, the German dua, dre. would lead us to the cou-
clueion that uwas the most ancient articulation-vowel of this root.
And there are evidences of an original form ddno. In its primi·
tive meaning, do reverts to the same sense as our “ do‚” and the

'German aaa. Like the Old Norae and Etruscan lato, aud like
