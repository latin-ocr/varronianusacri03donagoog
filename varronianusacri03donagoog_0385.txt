the othe'r deolensionl This is, to say tho least, aa daher:t 11¹> ‘³'
tion from a comparative philologer; for it substitutes an ar 1
conjecture, for an unexoeptr'onable induction. lf Bopp had hoen
thoroughly acquainted with the structure of the Greek and Latin
languages, he would have econ that the ultimate form of the
feminine always terminatas in a short a, and that the forma in a,
η, always involve some absorption ot* σ or ι. That the noune in
-ῑε are really noune in -ί- formed on thebaeis of nouus in -a,
may he shown hy a few simple consideratione. Itis admitted
by all philologers that in Latin ἑκ ai. Thus amtmao=amatmua
and eo forth (Bopp, Verp. oram. p. 66). Therel'ore dia=diaa
(cf. dianus, dte), mataria=maariais (cf. materia), &a With the
exception os the gen. pl, which is found only in two nouus, deca
and rea, the e nouus are inflected throughout iu accordante with
the forms os the ι’- deolension‚ supporting the contractior ai=a
For there is good authority for the gen. sing. in -ta Why the
gen. pl. in -ermm is of orech rare occurrence and whether the form
in -r'cm was ever found, are questions which it is difficolt to ·
answer. Itis clear that Cicero objected to spaeram (Τυρὼ. 7),
Quintilian to eperum (1. 6, ξ 26); and though we have, in late or
obsoleto authors, such forms assectarum (Cato, ap. Prisc. p. 7 82)
and placr'eram (Sidon. Apollon. Epist. 4, 6 exta), this proves
no more than tho occurrence of lepidorum and the like (above,
p. 334). On the whole, there cannot be any doubt that tho
noune in eo= ath ought to be placed aiter the nouns in o'of which
they are a contracted declension.

Gen. Pl. -U-am. ’

(β) It may be inferred thas noune in a either included or
were ultimately identical with the noune in -a', which have just
boen discussed. Thus in Greek -vo was originally · lte or -υις,
and the Oscan Ke-uo stando by the side of the Latin ei-vah
(above, p. 149). In most existing instancea, however, this ι’ has
been lost, and we have either aucun in v, deelined like the ·
purely consonant-noune, or a form in which the a is retained
throughout, just aa the a'alone keeps its place in the most regular
of the r’nouns. Ol the former class, we have only two remain-
ing: hos for hoo-a (Greek βοῦς), gen. boo-rh, and Jua lor ‹Iov-e
(Greek Ζεύς), gen. Jov-r‘s. The nominative of this latter noun
