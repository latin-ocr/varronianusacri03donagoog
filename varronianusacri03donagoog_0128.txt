appears in the comparative and superlative sdverhs lactea or
hond-rc, (Goth. diodor, O. N. tinem), and hond-omo, Goth.
tintcum, signisying “‚farthen” “lowen'' or “farthesff’ “lowest;”
so that lond may correspoud to cur yon or pendor: and asle
expresses proximity erc-lc and er-ont will gain the meaning of
“here” and “thera” from their terminations respectively; so
that cca-k, es-tu, and er-ont, may have corresponded in distinctiva
meaning to tha Latin lic, abta, illc, the first part being the same
in each, and identical with the initial syllable of cis-te.

The verbs generally occur in the imperative mood, as might
be expected, since the Tables eontain chiefly prayers aud injunc· ,
tions about praying. In these imperatives vve mostly recognize ·
a singular in -to, and a plural in ·tutu; as fit-tc (v1.a‚30‚ dre),
and fis-tcta (vl. h, 61), corresponding to ‹as-to, cr-tota Vcrhs
of the -o conjugaticn seem occasionally to make their imperative l
in -c, like the Latin See 1. b, 33: puae pur-tritico, kor'etm
pcfc upvcsfclcurant, pace cruc tor’a,· cpe ento teiuot, pastro
kapifiota: where, though the meaning of particular vvords may .
be doubtful, the construction is plain enough: postquam porb
rotro, caum ιιι apros foeorict, ihiprccaa duta· quando precer
dederit, postero (=rctro) conspicito. We often have the perf.
subj. botlr singular and plural, as may bc soen in the example .
just quoted. The pres. subj. too occasionally appears, the
person-ending in the singular being generally omitted, aa in
arce for orsc'es = cd-rr'aa and lubic for buboua The Oscan in·
finitive in om, as &aromaticum-fine, is also used in Um-
brian3 and ve often find the auxiliary perfect both in the
singular and in the plural. SeeV1.b,30: perse tow pcalclor
