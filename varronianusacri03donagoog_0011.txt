PREFAOE TO THE THIRD EDITION.

-4--.

ΗΕ caroful revision, which Ι bestowed upon the Second

Edition of this Worlr, has enabled me, on the present
occasion to escape a large ¹proportion of the renewed labour-
and study‚ which I must otherwise have encountered. Itis
true that my interest in Italian philology has rather in-
creased than diminished and the course of leetrnes on
latin Etymologies and Synonyms‚ which Ι had the honour
to deliver to some of the best Scholars in the University
on recommencing my residence at Cambridge in October,
1855, may be regarded as some sort of proof that in mat
ters of detail I had still, as Ι conceived something new to
say on the subjecte discussed in the following peges Some
of the results of those investigatione ¹will be found in the
present edition But these and other additions, though they
have irrmeased the bnllr of the present volume by et least
onefifth of the whole, are mainly questions of lexicograpby
and special detail As far as regards the general deduc·
tions in llthnography and Comparative Grammar, which
this bools undertakes to establish, 1 have had nothing to
alter, and the additional matter will be found to confirm
and illustrate what I had previously advanced.

Itis not neoessary that' Ι should restuto tho object
which 1 have proposed to myself in writing this book. The
'litio-page sufficiently intimatos that it is an attempt to
discuss the comparative philology of the Latin language on
the broad basis of general ethnography. My motto: licet
maoth Ι tultae pro Rornauts babeam-points to the attempt,
which I have made, to show historically how the classical
idiom of ancient Rome resulted from the absorption or

centralisation of the other dialects spoken in the peninsula
