amere, a form still preserved in sumus and columae. Again, in
old Latin the vowel of the crude form is preserved in the inflex·

ions, aa in arce-buc, opta-mac, poche-fic, &a But hr ull three
cases the laten Latin ‚exhibite an ιε thus we have omns,
nomiae, &c.; dicimus, scribimus, ἄτας orcibeta, optimus, ponti·
fic, &a In these cases we observe that u--o passas into-a

, simple 1. But there are other instances in which the transition

seems to go still farther. As the reduplication-eyllable is gene·

, rally shorter than the root-syllable in the preterita of verbs, we

should expect that the U or 0 in the first syllable of accurri,
momordi, pro-prepi, tutudi, would be an approximation to ΙΨ
Then, again, in melna, culmen, doc from colo, columen, dcc, and
in capariam, by the side of toga, the u is clearly less significant
than 0, though the u here may have been partly occasioned
by that affinity between a and l of which tha Ilrench imnishes
so many exemplos, and which we also see in the hansition horn
the Greek Ἀσκλήπιος, Ἡρακλῆς, Πατροκλῆς to the Latin
AEecahrpc'uc, Hereum, Patricoles, This light u or 0, however,
is inserted before the consonante iu the transcription from Greek

to Latin5 thus we have drachama, Alcwncnc, Alccmoeo, Tecu- ο

measa for δραχμή, Ἀλκμήνη, Ἀλκμαίων, Τέκμησσα (Corssen, 1.
p. 253). There are some cases in which we conclude that the U,
which iswritteu‚ has less weight even than 1. This might be
inserted from menalce the seoorrdary form of calco, which, ao-
cording to the above table, shouldbe either oon-alce or con-cclcc,-
end also from dffmrltus, sepultus, derived from difficule and
acpelcb. The fect seems to be, that what would bel before u,
becomes U, before L ς so thet u„ 1„ are both ultimate forms of
their respective vowels, and as such are in a stata of converg-
ence.

Accordingly, il we should seek tc arrange the Latin vowels
iu regard to their comparative weight, we should, as the result
of this inquiry, have the following order:

fl (as in maed, dc.);,U,‚ Ϊ,; Α, 0, U„ I,; E3 U„ Ι,.

¹ The older writers wrote maraordr', poposci, peperci, spopondi, according
to Gellius, N. A. vu. 9, who, however, says os the common spelling, “ita
nunc omnes ferme doctiores hujusmodi rechin utuntur.''
