the side ofprae-tor,· and perra-fro, compared with penitae shows ’

how this affin is related to the form of the second clement which
appears in t†r; for οωῑὶ-ειιεεούρανό-θεν, dic. We have the
same derivative forms, strengthenedby the subjunctive or opta·
tive i, in the desiderativeverbs, which seem to be deduced im·
mediately from 'the future participle3 thus, from serap-tor or
ambr-taras, we have scrip-tar-r'o; from peti-tor or peti-taras,
we have peti-tarel),- from armandam, we hare esdr-ab,
dcc. The variation in quantity between the desiderative verb
and the noun or participle, with which it is so intimately con·
nected, may be explained by the lengthened form of the verb,
and illustrated by mind-tr-a' compared with mitterer-iam, &c
The forms tipario or lr'parrab, statario or scater-rio, and the two
glossarial words vayarrit (ερον otiam vagatur) and steyaert-it ’
(= φλέγει), are not to be regarded as desideratives. They seem
to he derived from donus of the form of allas, tellaria· compare
scotarr'yo with prarr'po from prurio, which must be a derivative
from a word like prora, prora, praru or porra (cf. porrigo), ana-
logous to the Greek pulpa. The few verbs in -atr‘o, as coemto
cauae, seem to be derived from participial forms in aaa, lilre
those mentioned above, p. 467. lt is scarcely necessary to
observo after what hasbeen said, that the verbs of the first con·
jugation in -r'co must be referred to adjectives in -r'caa whether
they still exist or are only contained in these verbe: thus,
athico presumas an alb-icus as well as albna- compare ἀλφός
with λευκός, dcc. The same remark applies to the verbs in -ulo,
which must have proceeded from nouus in -alas ,· compare mo-
dala with malus, dre. In speaking of the derivative verbs we
must bear in mind that, although a verb may furnish thebaeis
of a series of derivative nouus, it may still have some parent
stock among the older names of things. For example, although
roy-atio, preco-tio, dre, are derivatives from rapo, precor, the fact .
that these verbs belong to the o conjugation shows that they are ’
themselves derived fram some primitive noun lilre pree-es. The
following tables will help the· student to determine when, in a
given case, the substantive is formed from the verb, or oica varod
· In general he will see that this depende on the appearance of 'a
derivative pronominal adjuret in either case.
