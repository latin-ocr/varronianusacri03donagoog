§fi B. Liqoid Verba.

Some of the verbs, which have lfor their characteristic,

double this letter in the present tense, but not in the perfect, ,

thus we have pello, pepuli, poteo, dre. The analogy of illa,

oliuo, dm, would lead us to infer that these verbs belong strictly κ

to the semi-consonant class, and the singular participle thalna or

latua from tollo, muli, coupled with the Greek form τλάω,

· would almost suggest the idea that there was once a collateral
verb in -α, There are only two n verbs, the reduplicatcd pigno,
root pec, perfect penui, and cano, perfect cecini. But the
known relationship between illo, aliua and ἀνά, together with the
meanings of alo, al-mua, ol-u-mnus, which imply “ bringing up,’'
suggest the possibility that this verb may have belonged ori-
ginally tc thesemo form of the liquid characteristic. We have
seen above that l aud n araboth dentale, and that they are
frequently interchanged. Although a is hy its origin a result of
the gutturals, it often posses into the dental r ,· and there cau be
little doubt that most of the verbs iurand a must bc placed in
the same category. Indeed it has been suggested that sero,
omui is merely a reduplication for reso. While the other liquida
are all capable of some connexion with the deutal. articulatim,
the labial m stands apert from any interchange with the other
letters of this class, except in the case of an assimilation, as iu
pressi from pruno (ef. jubeo, jussi). The most important and
remarkable of the m verbs is aneo, which is worthy of special
examination, not only on its own account, but also on account oi
its numerous eomponnds. The primary meaning of ento is, “I
take up or select,” and thus it comes very near in signification to
lego. This idea of selection lias at the root of the ordinary
meaning of enm, “I buy ;’' for this presumas a selection frema
variety of objecta offered for sale. In our own colloquial English,
“I will take this,” is the usual phrase for expresaing an intention
’ to purchase some particular article. The Greek πρίωμαι ap·
pears as the middle of πιπράσκω, “I cause to pass over;'' and
the two together express the changing of hands (πέραν) which

always attende a sale. And as ἀποδίδομιιι means, “ Ι give away ᾗ
for my own benefit‚’' i. e. “ Ι part with albing on advantageous ’

tenus,’' so ὥνέομαι (from the same root as ὀν-ίνημι) declares the
