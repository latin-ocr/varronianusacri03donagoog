Biz, “a year.” This word frequently occurs before numerals in
sepulchral inscriptions3 and, as the word asyll=aetctris gene·
rally precedes, sil is supposed with reason to mean annam or
anum. It is true that this word does not resemble any
synonym in the Indo-Germanic languages ; but then, as has
been justly ohserved by lapsine, there is no connexion be·
tween annua, ἔτος and altr, and yet the connexion between
Greek, Latin, and German is nniversally admitted ². The word
rit appears tome to contain the root rc or re, implying “ flnx”
and “ motion,” which occurs in every engloge of the family,
and whichinthe Pelasgian dialects sometimes fornished anama
for great rivers (above, p. 56). Thus Rhe-rb, the Tuscan
river, is probably “tho mountain-stream;” see below, ᾗ 6.
The termination -l also marks the Tnecan patronymica, and, in
the lengthened form -b'na, serves the same office in Latin (e. g.
Servi-lico from Semne). The Greek patronymic in -δης ex-
presses derivation or extraction, and is akin to the genitive-
ending. This termination appears in ῥεῖ-τον, ῥεῖ-θ-ρον, dec,
which may therefore be compared with ri-l. If the l repre-
sents a more original a, rr‘l eomes into immediate contact with
the Icelandic renna “to tnn” οι “flow,” whence recondi
commestam, and the river Reice probably received
its name from this source, for resana, A. S. rr'n =carras oqcoe.
How well suited thia connexion is sor the expression of time
need not be pointed out to the intelligent reader. The fol-
lowing examples from the Latin langrmge will show that the
etymology is at least not inconsistent with the forms ol speech
adopted by the ancient Italians. The Latin name for the
year-anana, more anciently anm—of which annulae or
anulus (Schneider, Lot. Gr. 1. p. 422) is a diminutive-denotas
a circle or cycle-a period-a curve'retnrning to itself3 and
the same is the origin ol the other meaning of ansa, i. e. ab
