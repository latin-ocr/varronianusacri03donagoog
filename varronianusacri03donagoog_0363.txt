ended in -d,· thus vvc find iu the Secutus Ooosalt de Bacch.
l. 24: quei advorsum ea-dfooisect. Again, we find in Senserit
that neuter plurale end in -m’,· thus madhu=uddv makes madlu-
πίε neda-m and the final i must he a vocalitation of a second a,
just as conversely aa is substituted for πί in ξέννοςεξὲνιοςε
ξεῖνος. Lastly, while the Erae plural of the third personal pro-
nonnis avltd ior suiad, the Welsh form of the plural is troyae
for noym. Putting all these facts together, we must come to the
conclusion that the neuter accusative singular ended in -rn=-a
= -t or -d, and that the plural ἄ represents an original -ad =-at
=·ao or -mm.

§ 10. The Vocatt‘oe.

The vocative, ie the case of allocution, exhortation, or ex·
clematius, is not distinguished from the nominative exceptis
noune of the second declension, and in certain Greek words
adopted hy the classical writers. When a noun in -oa has to be
used iu the vocative, the crude form is employed with the lightest
substitution for the characteristic vowel. Thus dominus makes
umam. Ili precedes the characteristic, the vocative e is ab·
sorbed, aud filice makes fili=fflia The sams is the case with
mure which has for its vocative mi= mee. Aa the regular nomi·
native plural ot' doceis dt, the Romans, to avoid confusion, did
not use a vocative deo=da This rule does not apply to adjec-
tives, as Cynthio hom Cynthius, ΒρενοΙιῑο from Sperchias. The
vocative Θᾶῑ exposes the common error of pronouncing the dao-
tyl Gutta as atrochee; for if this had heen true the vocative
must have been Gai-c. In point of fact, Gaius is scanned regu·

larly in three syllables ; thus we have (Martial, lx. sp. 93):

v. 4. Pervigil in pluma Gaea, ecce, jacet.

v. 7. Quod debes, oar, redde, inquit Phoebus.
r. 10. uuas et mallet verbera mille pati.

v. 12. Non mavis quam ter ortas esse tuus.

Similarly (id. xl. 36):

v. l. Gutta hanc lucem gemma mihi Julius alba.
v. 8. suarattaratae et Proculus.
