01 articulatim, A, 1, 03 the other comprising the vocaliaed conso-

nants 1 and 11. In other words, there are only three distinct
. vowels, A, 1, 11 ; for 1 and o differ from A in weight only.

' The original alphabetis a syllabarium consisting 01 breatbings
and consonants, which are articulated by the sound A. Now the
character A, in its original application, denotes the lightest of the
breathings, the characters the heariest 01 them, and the cha-
racter 0 a breathing which is intermediate in weight. Conse- ⁶
quently, on the principle that the lightest vowel always oo-existr
with the heaviest form (see N. Orat. ἐξ 101, 222, dra), when
these breathings were no longer indicated by distinct chmactera,

. A would represent the heaviest articulatim-vowel, s the lightest,

and 0 that which stands between them in point of weight. That ¹

this is actually the order of the articulation·vowels, considered in
respect to the weight of the combinatione in which they are
found, is clearly established by an examination 01 the 01116113
forms in the most perfect of the Indo-Germanic languages.

The vowels 1 and 11 result from the voealbeuon, not of
hraethings‚—as is the case with A, rs, 0,—-hut 01 mutes. The
former is the ultimate state 01 the soltened or assibilated gut·
turals and dentale, the latter is the residuum 'ol the labiala
(N. (1011108). Even in ceses, in which they are regularly
used as vowels, 1 and U oocasionally rerert by syuizesis to their
consonantal use. Thus we hare moabia (Lucret. 111. 741) and
wonabe'o (Verg. Aba. 1. 73) ; Meet (Pers. 11. 10), abac (Verg.
[22111. 16), pmbcapimn (Horat3 Germ. 11. 6), as words 01
three syllables; and anatthemate), duarum (Ter. Heaut. l
11. 3, 85) aa two syllables, duellica (Lucr. 11. 661) as three sylla·

bles, tace (Ter. Andr. 1. 5, 61) as oue syllable 3 in which 1 endu 1

are pronounced like r or 1 and 1 01 w (see Corssen, 11. 167 sqq).
But, though they are 01 different origin from A and its subordi-
natas, they must be considered, especially in the Latin languege,
as occasionally approximating in sound to the rowels derived
from breathings, and aa representing thern in certain maes, where
forms of an intermediate weight require an intermediate weight

· 01 vowels. This will be best shown by examples, from which it

will appear that the vowels 1 and n hare shades 01 velue, or
rather that they admit 01 subdivision into other vowels, differing
from them in weight, as 1 and 0 differ from A, but not expressed
