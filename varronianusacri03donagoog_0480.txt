compare 11111-10, τίκ-τω with reu-vu, tte-m, dre. We may
00100 10 the same conclusion with regsrd 101110 Latin verbs 10
-10, as fleo-to from the root flue· in flaccidas, 1110. As nis

opposed to the continuous or iterative meaning 01 the verb,

it may seem surprising that the most common 110110 frequenta· η

tives end in -ito ,· but these, as we shall see in the next chapter,
arc derivatives 01 0 very different kind. Of the Latin verbs in
·to, 0101110, the most instructius is ver-to. The 111000 01 turning,

changing, 01111 beginning to be, 11010000011000 source, and refer i

themselves to one conception in the mind. It is difficult to say
which is the primary modification 01 the thought. Perhaps the
word vertumnus, which has long been reoognised as 0 participisl
1000 11010 verto, will lead us most easily to the original meaning
01 the root. It isusual to consider the Etruscan deity Vertum-
nus 00 the god 01 the autumn or 01 the ripe fruita (so Creuser,
1111111111. 665); but the co-existence 01 the word auctumnns

shows that this cannot he the correct 1101101 the matter. As 1

the husband 01 Pomone, the summer-goddess, Vertumnus begets
01000100, the darkening time 01 the year, and must therefore, in

himself, be a personification of the spring, ver, which is actually ¹

included in his name. For 101-τ ver-t (saep-r) is the period
when the gcrms 01 the fruit first come 1010 being (compare
wesen with socr-den), and this, aa the beginning 01 new life, is a
change from the previous state 01 decay and non-existence. We
may say that Vertumnus 101 Vertunnus, 01. Neptunus for Nep-
tumnus) is the year when “it changes itself,'’ or puts on a new
dress3 0010011100ον0 Favont, 10 the language of Lucretius, is
not only reserata, or released 11010 110 1010101 bondege in the

dungeone 01 winter, but also genitabilis, or the cause 01 birth, .

we may 000 that Vertumnus, the god 01 change (Ovid. cht.
vr. 410; Prop. 11.2,10; Ηο101. 11. Serm. 7‚14), 10 also 1110
representative 01 the generation or birth 01 the 110110, which lic
fecundating under the care 01 Ρο10000, until they spring up into
the Auotumnus=Auetomenos or growing year. Thus the Hebrew

' ‘llll’ which denotes the autumn, is used as an expression 101

maturity, as in Job xxrx. 43 and if the same root indicates also
a falling away, decadenoe, and consequent reproach, we only
come to the idea suggested by Oceculus, another expression for
the Autumn, as the child of Vertumnus and Pomona The
