The true classification of the crude or uninflected forms ol
the Latin noun is obviously that of the letters which constitute
the distinctive characteristico. And the crude-form may always
be deduced from the genitive plural by omitting the final syl-
lable whether it be -om or 7rum¹. Thus we know from the gen.
pl. urbi-om, that the original form of arb-s must have been
orbi-e, just as conversely we find orb-a, nab-a, hythe side ol the
common orbi-s, nube-s. At first sight all these forms fall into
, two great divisione, according as they terminate in vowels or
consonante. But while, on the one hand, the vowels themselves
are distinguished by their stmcture aud origin aa vowels of
articulatiou and vocalized consonante, so thet the latter belong
to the consonant class when considered according to the genesis
of the crude-form,—on the other hand the consonants are not
less distinguished among themselves, according to the organ by
which they are uttered‚ and according to the difference between
inutes and liquide, than they are discriminated from the pure
vowels. The scientific or methodical order of the declensions
must be one which enables us most easily to fall back on the
root of the noun, and on the original formos those pronominal
affixos by which it is extended or developed, before it becomes
the vehicle of the case-endings. And il the vocalized consonante
