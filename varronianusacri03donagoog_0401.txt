times peres). If we except that meaning of r‘c, which hes heen
ulreedy mentioned, and according to which it appears as the cor·
relative and antecedent to qui-so thet r'e φη· means “the perti-
cular person who,'‘ and the relative sentence becomes equivelent
to the Greek participle with the article-we shall find that sir
and its two derivatives enable us to reprodnce in Latin the dif-
ferent neeges of αὐτός. Thus, e'e is e mere pronoen of reference
- like the oblique cases of αὖτόςτ uxor ejus is the exact countcr-
part ofrj γυνὴ αὐτοῦ, “his wife” or “the wife of e person
already mentioned and referred to ;'’ and junpit eos rendere ζεύγ-
νυσιν αὐτούς, “he yokes them‚’‘ i. e. the cattle already mentioned.
Idem means more emphaticelly “ the very he‚” “the seme man,’'
like ὁ αὐτός. And ἐρυθ signifies “the man himself‚” or “ the
man distinguished from others‚'' like αὐτός, when it is used as a
secondcry predicate in apposition without the article (Complete
Greek Grumm. art. 444, d, aa). The deelension of e'c, namely, r'e,
ea, ol, gen. ejece dcc, is preserved in i-dem for sis-dem, ec-dem,
edem for eil-dem, gen. ejus-dem, ccc„ so that dem becomes a
mere appendage like the Greek περ, δή, to both of which it
partly corresponds in meaning, and to the latter of which it is
directly related. In the classical use of gree, on the contrary,
the first part, or the cle, remeius uninflected‚ while the second
syllable is regularly declined3 thus: i-pse(-ce)‚ ipro, ipsum,
gen. ipsius, dee. There are two ways of expleining this pheno·
menon. We may suppose that the ps· represents au inversion of
the reciprocel σφ- analogous to the Dorio ψέ, plo: and thus the
inflexion of the second part only will correspond to the Greek
forms ἐμαυτοῦ, demoni, dcc, where the first pert is immoveable.
This is Bopp's theory. But it may with justice be objected
thet gree corresponds to αὑτός, and that we have the combine·
tione me ipsum, ee speum, dcc. Resides, we find in the older
writers thet the included isis regularly declined‚ while the affix
·pee remains as an immutableappendsge, just like the -dem of

s‘dem thus we have eam-pse (Plaut. Or'stell. 1. 3, 223 Aul. ·

’ v. r), mapa rura (corae. ιν. 3, 2), epu ou (run n: ane
especially in the combination re err-pre, or reapse (Festus, p. 278,
Miiller). Since therefore we lind another effix pte also appended
not only to the declined forms of r'e, as in cepte (Festus, p. 110,
ef. cpnppemperpte, p. 105), bnt also to coe, milei, meo, suo, dcc,
