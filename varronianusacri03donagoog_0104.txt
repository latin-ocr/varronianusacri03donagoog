ingredient in all the Teutonic tribes of the meinlsnd, who were
not similarly affected by Sclavenism. As I have elsewhere sug-
gested (Νοιο Orat. ξ 78), the Lithuanians were Low-Germane
thoroughly Sclavonizcd3 the Saxone or Inpoeoooes were Low·
Germane untainted by Sclavenism, and but slightly influenced by
mgb-(termonem the Franks or Iecoeoonee were Low-Germane
over whom the High-Gemrans had exereised considerable control 3
end the Thuringians or Herminones were pure HighGermcns, in
the full vigour of their active opposition to the tribes among
which they had settled. For Low-German unaii'ected by any
qualiiying clement we must go to the Sceudinavian or Norae
brauch of the rece, which contains the Danish, Swedieh, Nor-
wegian, Faroic, end Icelsndic tribes. The oldest or standard
form oi the languagee spoken by these tribes is the Old Norse or
Icelandic, which not only existe es a spoken tongue, but is also
found ine very flourishing and ancient literature. The present
inhabitants of Icelnnd traco their descent from emigrante who
settled there in the ninth century; and, from circumstances con-
nected with their moleted position, the lenguage has remained the

uneltcred representative oi the oldest known form oi Scandinavien ³

or pure Gothic. Itis therefore with this Old Norse or Icelendic,
the languegc of the Sages and Runes, thet we must compare
the old Etruscan, if we wish to approximate ιο the common
mother of both, on the hypothesis thet they are both traecable ιο

the same stock. But the reader must from the first be guerdcd
against the ridiculous idea thet I identify the Etruscan with
the Icclandic¹. The proposition which I maintein is this: that
