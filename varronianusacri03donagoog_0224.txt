north-western part of Etruria—it is obvious that we cannot
expect to find one uniform language in tha inscriptions, which
belong to different epoche and are scattered over the territory
occupied in different proportione by branches of cognate tribes.
Accordingly, we must, if possible, discriminate between those
fragments which represent the language in its oldest or un-Ra-
senio form, and those which exhibit scarcely any traces ofa
Pelasgia character.

Of all the Etruscan cities the least Rasenic perhaps is Coere¹
or Agylle, which stands in so many important connexione with
Rome. Its foundation by the Pelasgicos is attested by a great
number of authorities (Serv. ad AEa. v111. 4783 Strabo, v. p. 220;
Dionys. Hal. 111. 583 Plin. H. N. 111. 8): its port, Ilrlpyoa, had
a purely Pelasgiau or even Greek name, and the Pelasgians
had founded there a temple in honour of Εἰλήθυια (Strabo, v.
2263 Diod. xv. 14). In the year 534 ac, the people of Agylla
consulted the oracle at Delphi respecting the removal of a curse;
and they observed, in the days of Herodotus, the gymnic and
equestrian gemes which the Pythoness prescribed (Herod. 1. lert:
moreover, they kept up a connexion with Delphi, in the same
manner as the cities of Graece, and had a deposit irr the bank
of the temple (Strabo, v. p. 220).

As the Agyllaeans, then, maintained so long a distinct Pe-
lasgian character, we might expect to find some characteristica
in the inscriptions of Caere, or Oervetri, by which they might
be distinguished from the monuments of northern and eastern
Etmria. There is at least one very striking justification of this
supposition. On an ancient vase, dug up by General Galaesi at

Etruscam, because they both called their gods Esar, and who had re·
cognized the root of thia word in tha name of Ario.
