the original words, the latter being subsequent modificetions:

compare querra, “ war,'' poardz're, “ward,'’ dcc. with the French ἢ ³

pronunciation of quaerre, paerdir, dre. (Nero Orat. ξ 110).

When the labial ingredient of Q, is actually vocalized into u,
the Q ie expreseed in classical Latin by the new tenuis c=x3
’ thus quojao,qnoi‚ the original gen. and dat. of qai, become cajus,
coi,· oei rei becomes eor,· qoem is turned into σαψ aequamus,
equulus, torqolezr (comp. torqueo), quiris (cf. Quirinus), dec. are
converted into secundos, ocelim, torcular, cirria &c.¹ This is aleo
the case when o is represented hythe similar Roman sonnd of
the o. Thus eolo must bave been originally quolo,· for Q is the
initial of qoolom'a on coins, and ire-quidinde is obviously derived
from eir-eolo, which bas lost its a, just ae quotidie ie written coti-
die (Schneider, Lot. Gr. 1. p. 335). It is known, too, that coqore
- must have been pronounced quoquae even in Cicero’s time; for
he made no differente in pronunciation between the particle

‘ qnoque and the vocative of coquas: see Quintil. vr. 3, §472

“ Quae Ciceroni aliquando...excidernnt‚ ut dixit, quum is candi·
datust, qni coqui filius habebatur, coram eo suffragium ab alio
peteret: ego qnoque tibi favebo ².'' The change of qvo into ca
is particularly remarkable when a syllable is shortened, on ac-
count of the heavier form in which it occure3 as when quatri>

in composition becomes maeatae, pereuni), &a Perhaps we
ought to write acilo in those cases in which aqua appears aa a
trisyllable (Iachmann ad Deerat. VI. 552).

The two constituent parts of Q, often exist separately in
different forms of the same root: thns we have maniosa, conari&

11(φύω),χασ1χαοιω;11111111,χωί aa, a...-

1 It ie laid down by modern scholare that a can never follow
qur thus we must not write quana, loquacem, worm, queo, dec, bnt
earn, loannem aecana, acar, &c (muller, ud Vae-roa. p. 383 Lachmann,
od Latrat. pp. 172, 220, 398; Wagner, ad Verq. AEa. 11. 2993 lateant
Prolaq- Pleot. p. 943 Sillig, Praef. Pria p. 72), But 1 hope that this
rule will uot be adopted generally by editore, and that in writing modern
Latin at all events we shall still be allowed to fflstinguieh between qaum
the conjunctior and cam the proposition, without reeorting to the old-
t'aehloned quom lor the former.

²There are some remarks on thie snlrject in Erasmus, Compara,
p. 164, ed. Ametelod. 1651. ·
