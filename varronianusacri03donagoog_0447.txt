swond person plural of the passive 'is ol such rare occurrence,
that we cannot draw any decided conclusione respectiug it; but
if such a form aa audi-dhamim’ occurred, it would eertainly
ocosion some difficulty3 for one could scarcely understand how
the θ’, which seems to be the augment of the auxiliary suffia,
could appear iu this apparently partieipial form„ Without
stopping to inquire whether we have any instanees of the kind,
- or whether amabamim' might not be a participle aa well as
arna-bundas (compare ama-biba dra), it is sufficient to remark
that when the origin of a form is torgotten, a false analogy is
often adopted and maintained. This secondary process is sully
exemplified by the Greek &lde-ccv, τυπτέτω-σαν, dte. (Neu
Grae. ς 363).

Nor need we find any stumblingblock in the appendagc ot‘
passive endings to this neuter auxiliary verb. For the construc-
tion of neuter verba with a passive affin is common enough in
Latin (a g. peccatur, vennam eat, dre.); and the passive infinitiva
fieri, and the usual periphrasis of iri with the supine, for the
future infinitiva of a passive verb, furnish us with indubitable
instaneea of a similar inflexion. We might suppose that tha
naen ntus wa mosny formes penetres, ens e
as an auxiliary like the Greek ᾖα λέγων, Fr. J’allos's dire,
“I was going to say.” lt so, annana eo, mmm ire, would
be the active futures of the indicative and infinitivo, to which
the passive forms amatum cor, amatum iri, would correspond.
The latter of these actually occurs, aud, indeed, is the only,
known torm of the passive infinitive future.

Properly speaking, there are only three main distinctions

⁶ of mood in the forms of the Latin aud Greek verb, namely, the

indicative, the imperative, aud the infinitiva. The Greek gram.
mars practieally assign tiva distinet moods to the regular verb,
namely, the indicative, imperative, conjunctive, optative, and
infinitiva· But it has been already proved (Neu Orat. §388),
that, considered in their relation to one another aud to the other
moods, the Greek conjunctive and optative must be regarded as
differing in tense only. The Latin grammarians are contented

with four moods, namely, the indicative, subjunctive, imperative, κ
