explains the metaphor in Seneca, de Beneflo. 1v. 1'2 cum cirtae
nec lucrum invitet, ow &emeat domno, αᾱεοφω neminem cpe oc
polticrtotahac corrumpat, utcontra a'a se impenderejubeat et sceptus
r'n altro munta rit—that is, virtue belongs to the class of those
’ contracta which imply an initiatory expenditure on the part of

those who let thern out. To complete the analysis of the third ,

indicative morrona, it ia worth while to notice that the affin

hunt or bont, which marks this pronoun iu Umbrian, is clearly ,

connected with the English yon in pondu, he-yond, dcc, and this
brings us at once, through the Goth. jains„joind, N. H. G. jener,
dn, to the Greek κεῖνος, aud the root of illo. And thus we see
⁴ that the common Latin, like the Greek, has lost the three full
forms ot the distinctiva pronouns, which are preserved in the
Umbrian cra-lc (= chio = tto), “the particular thing here,'’ es-tu
(= rur), “ the particular thing where you are,'' and ar-ont = cs·
ont (= -aeivor = itte), “ the particular thing yonder.'‘ The form
ἐκεῖνος may be a residuum of ἐσκεῖνος = ‹ra-oar, and the same ex-
planation may apply to snt, dra. Praeticdly we lind that rte

is as ἄλλος = ἅλιος differs honr ἕτερος for cal-iac, taam denote
“that other person of many,’' and ator, ἅτερος “that other
person of two.” On the general differcnees in meaning and use
between the comparative affixes in dus or ‘ior and ·ter-, the
reader may consult the Nero Orotylnr,§165.

, The elementa ass, eto, e-ro, ln‘-, which, we have seen, con-
stitute the initial syllable or syllables of the indicative pronouns,
appear without any affix in the merely distinctiva pronoun dr.
In the older Latin Grammars it used to bathe custom to exhibit

the indicative hic as a sort of prepositive article: but this func- ¹

tion, so far as the latin languege· is· capable oi perior-ming it at
all, belongs rather to the wacker torm ir, which dutinyasirhu
the particular person referred to, especially when the distinction
is supported by a defining relative sentence. Thus, is fito in
Sallust, Catil. c. 19, is as nearly as possible d Πίσων. The
functione of rh, as a distinctive pronoun, are carried still further
by its association with two derivativas i-dern and rsspre (some-
