“ adverbial‚'‘ and is made up of indeclinable words, the first part

stuc? It appears from this enumeration that classes (3) and
(5) -are determinative, class (4) is syntuctsbul, cluss (2) iupos-
seseive, and class (1) is merely cn aggregation of terms. The
following· examples will suffice, so far as the Iatin language·
is concerned. '

(1) There arc no Latin decadae, unless we recognize such a

¹ form in nuenarilfflsmtesfemteetaurile. But the Latin ,

lnuguage, especially in its oldest form, abounds in exalnples cf
nouus aggregated together so as to form one notion, and without
any copulative conjunction3 thus we have populas Roranam
Quieta for the united people of Romans and Sabinas (Niebuhr,
Η. Β. 1. p. 294); Patres Gommpti, lor the combination of two

(2) Of tutemet componnds there is a long list in Latin.

> In addition to the possessives mentioned above, we have com-

pounds made up of substantivas and their epithets, as versi-
cour, multi-caulei, octe-pediam of numerals and substantivas, as
quadra-pes, bidens, quiaque-phliun- of prepositions and substan-

belong the oppositos, pro-sper or praeparas, “ in accordnnoe with
our hopes”(Non.171,25: sperem veteres pro apem dicebant,
unde ct prospere dicimus, he. prospe) and a-cper‚ “contrary
