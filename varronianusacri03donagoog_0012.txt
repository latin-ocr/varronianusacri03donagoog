And this result is justified by the ethnological deductione
here presented to the reader,'wh10hprove that, with the
exception of the Celtic substratum, which is occasionally
appreciable, there are no elementa in the old population of
Italy which may not be regarded, as either Sclavonian, Low-
Germau, or that well-fused combination of those two branches

' of ne aas family, which we term Lithuaman. lu these

elements are homogencous, and the political union enforced
by the conquesta of the Imperial Oity on the Tiber natu-
rally led to a perfect combination or absorption of idioms,
which have been partially fused in other parts of Europe&¹
The only part of the ethuographical theory propounded
in the former edition, which has not been received with
general and tacit assent, is the hypothesis that the Rasenic
or non-Pelasgian clement iu the Etruscan is ultimately
identical with the primitive form of the Scandinavian lan-
guages A mreful and scrupulous review cf all the evi-
dence, and an impartial consideration of all the objections
raised by those who took a different view of the question,
have only tended to confirm my conviction of the validity
of the results, at which I had anived3 aud 1 trust that
the additional arguments and illustratione, which I have
brought sarward iu the present edition, will increase the
number of those who ,have recognized in this solution of
the Etruscan problem the germs at least of a lingnistic dis·
covery tirmly restIng on the oirly available induction.
