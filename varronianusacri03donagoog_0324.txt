overpowered the guttural, which was either lost altogether or
pronounced only as sn aspiration. We have traces of this in the
modern Italian pronunciation of alessandro, odsi, dre. The
Greek &derived its name from tlte Hebrew alsia, and perhaps
occasionally represented it in sound. A sibilant or aspirate often
changes its place: thus the Gothic dv ia in English wh, the
Ι Greek Ιιν is the Latin rlr, and the Greek ξ = κσ- might occasion-
ally be ‹rx-t compare the transposition in the oriental words
laeander, Scandereon, Gandahar, all derived from the Greek=
Ἀλέξανδρος. The last of these words is a mutilation which
reminds us of the modern Sootch division of the name Alexander
into the two abbreviatione Alica and &uades or 'Sandp When
, the transposition was once effected, the sostening of the guttural
was obvious and easy: compare σχέτλιος, “aretha’' εοΙιαᾶος

forms of the Roman language an original s has been snper-
seded by the dental sibilant R. Thus Quintilian tells us (Ι. 4,
·§ 13) that Valesius, Fasciis, arboe, labec, vapos, clamos, and
hess (ef. Pest. s. a), were the original forms of Valerius, Fa—
rina, arbor, labor, vapor, clamor, and larem and it is clear that
'Itanon honestas, are only different forms of onus, menalus. It
is rather surprising that the Jurist Pomponius (Diyp. 1. 2, 2,
§3ssl should have attributed to Appius Claudius Cacus (consulI.
=auo. 447, nc. 307 ; consul ΙΙ. auc. 458, ac. 296) the inven-
tion οἱ a letter which is the initial of the names Roma and
Romulus. He can only mean that Appius was the first to in-
troduce the practice of substituting n for s in proper names, a
change which he might have made in his censorship. It appears,
from what Cicero says, that L. Papirius Crassus, who was consul
in auc. 418, nc. 336, was the first of his name who did not
call himself Paphias (ad Furnil. 1x. 2llr “How came you to
suppose,” says Cicero, writing to L. Papirius Paetus, “that there
