We lind in both a parsimony of tense-lorms by the side ofa
lavish abundauce of derived or conjugational forms3 (d) the
complete coincidence of the Semitic and Sclavenicn laugnages in
regard to their unimpsired development of the original sibilents;
lor it is only in these languages that we find the three sonnds
ol eoin and zernb'a, of tenda and tsi, of samech and eboc: aud
while the formationes palatals has prooeeded to its lull extent
in Selavouisn and Arabio, the permanence of the pure sibilant
in Hebrew is shown by the fact, that, with a full array ol
breathings, there is no diminution in the use of the sibilante iu
nabot or as initials. (2) The most striking difference between
the Semitic and Sclavenian lauguages—and itisone which marks
the earliest ol the former no less then the most modern repre·
sentatives of the letter-*consiste iu the laet, that while the Semitic
langneges are all ins syntectical condition, having lost most ol
their inflexions, and exhibitiug all the machinery of definite
articles, prepositional determinatives of the oblique ceses, and
other uses of particles to compensate defecta of etymological
structure, the Sclavenio languages have never arrived atthis
syntectical or logical distinctness, und have never abandoned their
formative appendages and the other symptoms of etymological
lise aud activity. These differenoes are dne to the lact that
while the Sclavonic tribes have remainsd pure up to the present ’
time, aud have been remarkable lor their slew adoption of the
art of writing and their inferior literarp cultivation, the Semitie
uatibus were from the earliest times exposed to the frequent
iutermixtnre of cognate races, and were the first possessore of
au alphabet andos written records. We heve therefore, in the
antithesis or contrast of the Sclavouic and Semitic, a prool ol the
effects which external circumstances may produce on the state or
condition of a lauguage3 and the resemblances, to which I heve
called attention, must be taken as au indication of the perma-
ueuos of thet affinity which results from the geographical contact
and intermixtnre of two races st a very early period.
