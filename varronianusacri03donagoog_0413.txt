cannot depend upon the etymology 01 the suffix. If we compare
1010, quom with tnm, qnam, we shall see that while the former
pair refer 10 monn, the latter imply time. As drea signifying
0 particular day is always masculine, and as we have a number
01 adverbs counting time by days, as pridie, hodae, nndina 1001100,
diu, interdiu, dm„ it 10 fair 10 conclude that tum, qnam mean
“ on the particular day,” “ on which day 3⁸¹ and the same exple·
naticn will apply 10 olim, “on that dey.'’ Similarly, aa the
Greek adverbs in -ῃ are properly explained by an ellipse 01 ὁδῷ
signisying “way,'’ “promea” “mannen'’ aud 00 we have the
adverbs obonmfflercrbm, signilying directions or modes 01 motion,
it may be inserted that there 10 00 ellipse 01 ciam in 1010, qnam,
which would at once explain their meaning. Ι1 we apply the
same explanation 10 quaquam, we shall see that it means “any
000 10 any way,” i. e, “any 000 01 011” (01. per-qnam, “ina
very high way, manner, degree, or kind,” 00000101110 no
manner 00 degree,'' magnaeanum-inodo, and 000 Ρο11, Et.
Feroci. p. 149. aw. Aut). This is always the distinctiva
meaning 01 the pronoun; for 0011000000 can only be used in 0
negative or conditional sentence, where all are excluded, or

where the range 01 choica 10 circumscribed between the nar- ·

0000001 possible limite. Hence 10 Terence (Ennnclz. prol. l)
wc havet “ei qnihqnmn 001-10 his poeta his nomen profitetur
suum”-“ 11 there is any person 01 011, 11 there 10 any one person
in all the world”-where the number is especially limited.
Hence 0001001100 appended 10 qumquam (01. Liv. xxv111. 37,
where qnihqrrnm 0000 10 opposed 10 olii omnia, and 11. 9, where
pungnam unna is opposed 10 noioeane 0000100). Hence 0100
alimannia, “a little one,” “a mere one,” serves ae the
adjective 01 quodquam, which, as we have seen, has 00 femi-
nine or plural forms, though it occurs occasionally with femi-
nine nouns. The exclusive force 01 nnnc end nilne 10 well shown
by the modern French aucun =niiqnia unna, which performs 011

the 1000110οε 01 quoipiam, although the first word belongs 10 the .

most definite 01 these general pronouns. Thus non nidi quenquam
might he rendered je n'ai 00 perronna, 00 anenno personne.
And in English we sometimes use the word “single'’ 100 the
purpose 01 excluding all 01 the kind-as, “I have not 0 single

ahilling.” Opposed 00 quoiquam 1010 quei-qnia, 1110 very strange
