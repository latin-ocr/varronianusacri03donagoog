¹ ruption to the augurial process which was occasioned bya clondy

and starless night. Aa ploro, according to the etymology which '
isbere suggested, must have been originally ple-oro, and as pbr-

raa is acorruption of the old comparative pla-ores (abore, Oh. vr. ⁸ 2

§2), wc see a perfect analogy between the Old N orae fleira', Suio-
Gothic flare, compared with the latter, and the Etruscan pilares,
which has been derived from the former (above, p. 206). And
with respect to the meaning of pilares, the connexion of aarum,
¹ which expresses its application, with voco, which is a synonym
of ploro, may be seen in such phrases as Virgil's “cotia ad·
suesce voaarc‘'‘ (Gar-9. 1. 42), and “ octab vocaveris imbrem'’
(ibid.1.157). That the composition with os may appear ina
nonu aa well as in a verb, seems to be shown by three nouus in
-or, -orr'a, which have corresponding adjectivcs in was, namely
oua-dr-us, decbr-aa, son-oreas. As can-tua, decas (dr-ra), adnue
exist by the side of cao-m, dacor (aa), soaor, it is to be infer-red
that the longer forms involve an additional clement, namely or·,
’ “thadaee‘’ or“mouth.'' Thus wehaveinVerg.AEn.1v.150:
“ tantum egregio ᾱιοιω enitet crc.’' Servius tells us that εοπ-ον-
ua differs from sonans as denoting “quidquid sinc intermissione
sonum servat,” whereas concas means “qnod ad tempus an-
ditur.’' The relation then between soom and eonor is much the
same as that between σνγάω aud cranaha sonus being merc
round, and aanor “voice-sound.'' Of. Lucret.1v.570, v. 334.

Similarly conor is musical sound, continuone like the utterance
of the voice, aad Ovid says (A. A. 111. 315): “res est blanda

coam: discant caetera puellae,’' referring of course to the sound ,

or melody of the human voice in singing. Another verb of the
first coujugation which deserves some notice is flato found in itu

eompounds coa-few and reflato. According to Festus (p. 89), l

Cato used fiseo as a frequentative of fao or fio. Bnt this is not
the origin of sato as found in these eompounds and in the ad·
jective fictilia, &a This verb is connected with fadaia (ευαε
aquariam, Varro, p. 47, Malla) andfaado,· and conficto, rafica,
which are hequentatives of fiao,·whence foas and fimdua (see
below, Ch.1111.§9) are applied to the act of ponring in cold
water with a ladle to prevent the hettle from boiling over;
