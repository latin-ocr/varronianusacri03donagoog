§11.] rus LATIN essu-srsrnrr. 343

the Umbrian este represents the Latin ἰ-εα, so i-qo'· msy corre-
spond to cs·90= ‹rr-po, which is strictly a synonym of igi-tur.
The termination -tcr, -tsr, is, in fact, the sameas -tcs, which is
appended to substantivas and adjectives of the second declension:
thus we have coli-tres, suedi-tua, rodebecco, amoenitas, divini-
tos, humani-tos, dcc. This last, which isobviously the older form,
ansvers to the Senserit aar, on the ons hand, and to the Greek
-θεν on the other (compare the Greek first person plural in -μεν
with the Latin in πω). There is yet s third form in which it
appears, namely, -tc'm, which is the termination of a most interest-
ing class ol participial adverhs3 for I csnnot consent to consider
any ol them as strictly formed from nouns; and though the
verbs in all cases are not forthcoming, the adverhs themselves
prove that they must have existed in pnrt at least. Instsuces of
this class oi adverbs are caterva-tim, corp—tim, prado-tim, privo·
tim, punc-trin, scprurostim, orco-tim (other examples are cited by

Corssen, 1. p. 266). Compare with these the German participial ’ ‚

forms in ·ispen, and the Greek participial adverhs in -νδιι, -νδην,
-δην (N. Orat. ᾗ 263). The most striking result from a proper ι
appreciation ol the origin of adverbs in -ts’m, is the explanation
which it supplies ior those adverbs in der which are derived
from active participles. The terminatiou of the supine is already ,
·tu,· the adverb, therefore, isa locutive case of the supine; lor
camno-tim scandes> caterva-tce in precisely the same relation ss
pur-tim to pars (par[t]s). Similarly, amos-ter, sapien-ter, dcc.
are cases of the participles amans, caprena, &cg for the crude
forms of these participles already contain the t. Now, if Ι am
right in concluding that these terminations, -θεν, -tac, -tcr, -tuc,
tim, dcc. are lengthened forms of that dentsl affix which marks
the ablative of the noun, most interesting conclusione may be
drawn from this respecting the origin of the participle and of
the passive person-endings ol the Latin verb. That there is no
' essential distinction between the terminations ·ts'm and -tcr, and
that the former is not restricted to participles of the passive for·
mation,isclea1· from such forms as pede-testim, dre. In fact,
while the -d or -ι alone is sufficient to express the participiul
relation, we find alsoa strengthened form which contains the
liquid, as well sethe mute denta13 thus we have as syno-
nyms not only cupi-dus but cups'cn(t)c, not only φυγά(δ)ς but
