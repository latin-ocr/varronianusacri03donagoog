and as iu this and other passages posiae, “I lay down,”is
opposed to aomo-:scema “I take up, ’' itis clear that poro is
merely a mutilated form of this verb' erac compcunded with the
proposition 'po in po-ae, po-st, &a But if we must recognize
eico, aivi, in pono, poma, po-sm, surely it is more clearly dis-
oernible ιιι oopeeao, oopeoarb, copes-sivi. Bopp's explanation rs
faulty cn every account—the invariable a before the terminumn,
tho o- form of the verb, the later or Greek origin of the in·
flexicn, the interchange of cs and a in existing specimens—-all

contributa tc show that ottebbso, -oe, dcc, do not belong to the ’

same class with capesso, -is, ωριςφιαιεσνε, &a 3 and the signi·
fication of these latter verbs, their form, and the analogy of the
old languages of Italy, all conspire to prove that the analysis
which Ι have suggested is truc. I must be permitted to add,
that the valus of the discovery is materially enhanced by the
fact that it lies deep enough to have eluded the search of one cf
the first comparative philologers of the day, who has been unable
to see the most important example of the accretion of verb·
forms, although he has abused in other respects a similar theory
os agglutination. The other affix, used for strengthening the
present, namely sc, generally gives an inchoativo meaning, and
is therefore, hythe nature of the case, as entirely excluded
fromthe perfect astho affix ιι. Ιιι most instances the pcr-
fcct follows the model of a corresponding vowel-verb, whether
real or possible; thus we havs cro-aco, oravi, (to be distin·
guished from the accidentally coincident perfect of cer-rao), oon·
cupfsoo, concupivi (cf. cupio), mltos-sco, coa-tioaa‘ (cf. tocco),
eaordoaoo, esar-ei (cf. ardeo), rao-eoo, ao-va', eci-ew, sci-ci, &c
But although we have pta-sco, pro-vi, the origin of the appendnge

seems to be forgctten in the compounds, and compeeoo, eom· ’

pascui, duc, treat the whole crudo form aa though it were an

independent root. Bopp (Gloea p. 225), who is followed by

Benfey (Woraellw.1.), considers posco as a corruption of proc-eoo
from the root of precor, procas, &c Το this theory, however,

thare are some grave objections; (1) the verb has no haee of an l
inchoativo scnse; (2) as it has a genuine or reduplicated perfect, ’

the case of compono-af does not explain the form poposci or
peperci (Valerius Antias, op. Gall. vn. 9) ; (3) there is no reason
for tha permanent o, which isonot found in precor, preces, drc3
