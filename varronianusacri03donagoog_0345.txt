ἐνθαῦτα o‘ Κῦρος (ἦν ιγὰρ ὁ χῶρος-ἅιιονθῶδην-μοῦτόν σφι
τὸν χῶρον προεῖπε ἐξημερῶσαι ἐν ἡμέρᾳ. lv. 118: τοὺς αἰεὶ
ἐμποδὼν γινομένους ἡμεροῦται πάντας. In all of these passages
the verb ἡμερόω implies making a clear passage or road3 and in
Plat. (Lepp. p. 761‘A) the adjective ἥμερος is used as a predi· ‘
¹cate of ὁδόςτ ὁδῶν τε ἐπιμελουμένους, ὅπως οἷς ἡμερώτατον ’
ἔκαστοι γιγνωντοιῑ. That the Greeks connected read-making
·with civilisation in general, and with the peaceful oommerce of
man with man, appears from many passages (Aristode, sicpl
θαυμασίων ἀκουσμάτων, c. 85, p. 837, Belrk.; Thucydides Ι, 2,
compared with 1. 13, dcc.); ,and this is generally implied in all
the legende relating to Hercules and Theseus. But it has not
been sufficieutly remarked that this mad-making was also in·
limately connected with the cultivation oi lund It may, how-
ever, be shown, that as the Greek ὄγμος becomes ἥμερος when
divided by a read, by a similar process the Latin ομιτ becomes
ybperum=diupcr-cnt.

Whenever a piace oi unemployed ground-of aper, so called
-was to be taken into use, whether for cultivation, or for the
site of a city or a camp, the rnles of the ancient limitationem
immediately applied. Now this very word limitatio significa
the dividing of a certoin pieoe of ground into main-reads (ate)
ond crossssmads (limites); and the same primary uotion is con- g,
weyed &Qec-plum> so obviously derived from lem-uo, Gr. reip-t
νω, comp. τέμενος, &n For in all limitation the first thing done '
was to observo the templum, i. e. as we should say, to take the
bearing by the compass². If we suppose the augur stood with
bis back to the north⁸‚ then the line from north to south would

² Most encient natione seem to hove connected the οιμίοοιι cosli with
tho ”pionte υἰονυοι. Thus in old English ‘⁴ the milky way” was called
‘⁴ waning-street? which was the nsme oi one ol the four great roads in
this cunuti-ys see Grimm, Doutscho Myon p. 330, ad ed.. sud Drayton’s
Polyollt'oa, Song 1111. p. 389, with the illustratione to Song xvr. p. 403.

on his own discretion; for it is stated that hs looked oostward at tha
