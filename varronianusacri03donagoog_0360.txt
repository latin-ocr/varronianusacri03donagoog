336 rus aurun cass-svaran. [cunr. rur.

If there is any reason for using the term Mauo in reference
tc the case of a noun, it must surely be applicable to aare in the
epitaph of Plautus, quoted by Gellius (N. A. 1. 84) ι “Postquam
est morta datus Plautus, Comoedia lugct‚”—for herc the form iu
·e actually follows a verb of yioiny. Thus we see that ore is not
the ablative but the dative in (Virgih Gecrp. 1. 430) ε

si virgineum suffuderit ora ruborem
and that it is a locutive iu (Gecry. 111. 439) ε

linguis micat ora trisulcis.

' This usage occurs iu the following passages of Propertius
(see Paley, adv. 8, p. 311), namely‚ 1. 17, 22:

molliter et tanna poneret ossa roco.
ιιι. 26, 84:

anseris indocto camina cessit olor.
ιι. 6, 24:

si placet insultet, Lygdum, morta maa.
v. 8, 10:

eum temera caprino creditur ora manus

ξ 7. The Accusatioe Singulae

The aa, which marks the accusative singular iu Latin and
Senserit, is only a wealrer form of the dental ν, which appears
iu¹ Greek. This dental is the residuum of the third pronominal

’ clement, aud denotas distance and objectivity. We are not to

suppose that partem aud purtim are the same word, or generally
that the accusative and locative are the saum form. The a·
which appears in the latter, with or without the accusative
affin, constitutas the essential difference between the two cases.
Belonging to the second pronominal clement, this iis in itself an
expression of proximity3 and thus, while parte-m denotas that
.“,thc pa1t” is au object to be approached or acted on, port-iau
indicates that not only is the part an object, but also that it is
close at haud for use or superposition. It is true that the tem-
poral partiales qaam, tam, naue, jam, dau, are not less locutive
iu meaning than olim, and that the causal uam, though accusative
inform, coincides in signification with the locutive caim. But
we must remember that qaod, qaod si, quaprpa=quipta ὅτι,
ὅτε, ὅτε, dcc. are used as general expressions of objectivity; and Ι
