nution of assertion expressed by minos took the place ol the
shorter negative3 thus we have si minas ior sin, and quominus
for quia. It is a question whether the shorter form ne can
appear without some strengthening affix, as -dam, ·qoe, or
parilem, in the categorical negation. Ol the passages quoted
some are manifestly corrupt, and it seems that ae is not used
categorically, except when it stands for rra-quidem, “ not even”
(see Drakenborch, od Liv. v11r. 43 xxxin. 49). It may be
doubted in these cases whether there is not a ooncealed prohi-
. bition, as in the Greek μὴ ὅτι. On the other hand, when aon
appears, as it occasionally does, in a final sentence, there is always
some reason for the employment of this more emphatical par-
ticle. Thus aa plura dicam, or ut ne plara-a dicam, means
merely “not to say more,'’ but ut plara non dicam neque alrb-
rum wemplis confirmem (cie. pro lepe‘Mam'l. 15, 544) implica
a more deliberate abstinence from irrelevant details. The dif-
serence between oe-quidem and non-qaidam or nec-quidem con-
sists in'the greater degree of emphasis oonvcyed by the former,
which is much the more usual combination3 lor rra-quddam means
“not even;'' but non (or aee) -qoidem denotas merely a qualifi-
cation of opposed terme, so that quidam is simply the Greek
μένε this appears from Quintilian's rendering (IX. 3, ξ 55) of
Demosthenes (de Corona, p. 288): οὐκ εἷπον μὲν ταῦτα, οὐκ
. ἔγραψα δέ· οὐδ’ ἔγραψα μέν, orie ἐπρέσβευσα δέ· οὐδ’ ἐπρέσ-
βευσα μέν, οὐκ ἔπεισα δὲ Θηβαίους,-“ nort enim dixi quadem,
,sed non scripsi; aec scripsi perdens, sed non obii legationem3
aee obii qnidam, sed non persuasi Thebanis” (see Wagner on
Verg. Georp. 1. 126).

This distinction in emphasis regulates the employment of the
negative particles in interrogatione, and we observa the same
relation between the Greek and Latin particles in this use also-
that is, we employ noane in Latin, where we write ἆρ’ οὐ in
Greek3 num, which bears the same relation to ne that tirsus does
to r'ptse or aerarum to measse, corresponds to the Greek use ot*
μή or μὴ οὖνεμῶνς and the enclitio -ηέ is used when no nega-
tion appears in Greek; thus we have ἆρ’ oda ἔστιν ἅσθενής;
=nonne oeprotat? when we expect an affirmative answer; ἄρα ’
μή ἐστιν dodamin or patr ἀσθενής ἐστι 3=num aegrotat? when we
expect a negative snswer; and ripa ἀσθενής ἐστι ; = oeyrototee?
