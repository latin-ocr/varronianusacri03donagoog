rt'nrrorv3 and in the fixed or adverbial forms not only the adverbs
in da, -δόν, -δην, but also those iu -uda, -udou, -νδην, Now the ·
obvious derivatico of these latter mverbs entitles us to infer
that the participle-ending in -ut is a secondary formation from
a verbal noun, bearing the same relation to the simplet forms in
-d, -δ, that inde opposed to i-ot does to adridet· opposed to
ariri-lid. Consequently, the adverhs in question are really fixed
cases of participles, analogous to the forms which we call
supinas, gerundo, or infinitires. And the participle itselt' differs
only from these adverhe, and from the persons of the verb, in the
circumstance, that it ie not an immorable form, but one which
is capable ol regular flexion through the whole system of cases
(N. Orat.§§ 300, 415). With regard to the passive person·
ending in ‘r the fact that it is a locutive affix is proved to
demonstration (1) by the analogy between these adverbs in dna,
-δον, -δα, and the Greek passive person-endings in «a, -ην (cf.
δαί, δήν), νον, -a, ·o; (2) by the identity of meaning of these
. ⁵ adverbs with the Latin in -tt'm and -ter ,· and (3) hythe locatire
' value of igi-tur, which strictly corresponds in form to anua-tur
<see Nero Gratulor, §3653 below, Chapter xl. ᾖ 2).

Adverbs, used as conjunctione, are such as jam, nam, maire
(Sansor. tna), idm, tamen, dre. These are, in fact, cases oi
different pronouns. Most of them are of obvious origin. Thus

’ ¹In the text 1 have merely put together some of the analogias
suggested in my former work. The late Mr. Gamett, who raa one ot
tho soundest, and, at the same time, mort original philologers in thia
country, had arrived at some resulta which were calculated to oontlrm
and extend these viera. In a letter to me (dated ad May,1842)he said:
“I datter mysell that Ι can maire it appear from a pretty copioua induc-
tion that the Indo-Germanic present participle is formed upon the abla-
tire case ot the rerbal noun [Senserit tapeti in much the same way aa
the pronoun possessive in Latin, German, ito, is formed upon the geni·
tire oi the personat. 1t1am not mittaken, thia ia calculated to throw
an important light upon the organisation of the Indo-Germanic and many
other languagoa.” although there ia an important truth at the bacis ot
this theory, it seems to me to involve in the application a fallacy which
1 have pointed out elsewhere (Now Ciutylur, p. 511, ed. 3).
