these formatione, the grammarian naturally pasees on to an in-
vestigation of the cognate but subsequent procedure, by virtue
of which, (1) an existing nonn or verb developes itself into a
secondary form of the same kind, or (2) two or more distinct
words are combined in one, and furnished with a single set of
inflexione. This procedure is called word-building, and might
be designated as derivatsbn in reference to the materiale, and
composition in reference to the machinery. Praetically, however,
we confine the term doricam to the former department3 namely,
to the development of secondary words containing only a simple
root; while composition is used to denote the subordination of
two or more crude forms under the influence cf some set of fcr-
mative appendages and inflexione.

In considering the distinction between derivation and in·
herion, we must bear in mind, that the former process is really
nothing more than an extension of the latter. In forming a word,
in the first instance, by the addition of cases or person-endings‚
we' derive cnr formative materiale from the same limited and
classified stock of pronominal clemente, which fnmishes ns with
the machincry of derivation. Indeed, the new crude form, which
becomes the vehicla of the inflexion, is very often neither more
nor less than the oblique case of some existing word, and itis
probable that this process ¹has been repeated in successive de·
rivaticns. This remark appliee only to derivative nonna, for the
new forms of verbs cannot rest upon the inflexione, i. e. person-
endings, of their primitives. In general, we observo that there is

much greater variety in the secondary formatione of nonns than Ι

in those of verbs. For the person-endings of the latter antici·
pate the distinctiva nse of the three pronominal elementa in their
most prominent and important application, whereas the cases of
the noun are connected only with a special development of the
second clement, signifying proximity and transition of agency or
the point of motion, and of the third, denoting position and dis·
tance. In the derivative forms we find the converse phenomenon:
for while the verbs are contented with extensione of their crude
form, by pronominal additions limited to that special develop-
