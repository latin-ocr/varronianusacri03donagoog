The tendency of the spoken Latin language to clip and
mutilate itself began at an early period to militate against the
regularity of the grammatical forms. With regard to the verbs,
it has been shown above that the organis inflexione had baeu
in a great measure supersedcd by seoondary or compound anses
before the commenoement of the classica! age; and that the
person-endings are obliterated, or deformed by inconsisteueies, in
the oldest specimens of the written languagc. In regard to the
verbs, then, the change from the Roman to the Romanae is
merely a further development of that which was already in
operation. The Roman case-system was in itself more complete
than the conjugation of the rerb3 and therefore we may expect
to find greater changes in the Frcnch noun as compared with
the-Latin. In general it may be remarked, that when the
tendency toabbreviation bas commenoed its aetion on the flex-
ional forms of a languagc, certain devices are at onae adopted
for the purpose of preventing any syntactical obscurity. Indoed,
the logical or syntactical development of a language is generally
benefited by the change; and where the etymological organisa-
tion becomes imperfect, the literary capabilities of the particular
idiom are extended and confirmed.

There is good reason for believing, that in the spoken
language of the ancient Italians the differenoe between the sub·
jective and objectiva cases of the noun was at an early period
neglected or overlooked (see Lepsios, od Inscript p. 120). At
any rate, it is clear that this was tha first step towards the
· breaking up of the Roman case-system. The accusative casa
was substituted for the nominative, and all the subordinate
relations were expressed by prefixing prepositions to tho new
cruda form of the noun. We observe a tendency of the same
kind in vulgar English3 and perhaps this passage from the sub-
ject to the object may be explained on general principles, with·
out any reference to the want of grammatical education on the

¹ part of those in whom it is most observable. Comectad with

this employment of prepositions, to give definiteoess to the crude
· forms of nouns, is the use of the old Roman demonstrativas tta
