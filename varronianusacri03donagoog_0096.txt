s ιτ. saras mammos from etymoows

Les us edd to this comparison one feature which has not yet
boen observed. The Lithuanians were not only called by this
name¹, which involves both the aspirated dental tir and the wo-
calized labial a, but also by the names Lioonchn and Lettoncha,
which omit respectively one or other of these articulations. Now
it has been mentioned before, that the name of the Latius ex·

hibita the same phenomenon; for as they were called both Lassa ·

and Lucium, it follows that their original name must have been
Latuimhas, which is only another wey 'of spelling and pro-
nouncing Lithoam‘ens. If, therefore, the warrior-tribe, which
deseended upon Latium from Reate and conquercd the Pelasgicos,
gave their nemeto the country, we see that these aborigines were
actually called Lithuanians3 and it has been shown that they and
the Sabinos were virtually the same stoch. Consequently‚ the
old Prussians brought even their name into Italy. And what
does this name signiiy? Simply, “lreemen²;” for the root
signifying “frea” in all thc European languages consisted of l-
end a combination of dental and labial, with, of course, a vowel
interposed In most languagcs the labial is vocalized into a, and
prefixed to the denta13 as in Greek ἐ-λεύθε-ρος, Lithuan. liba-
dci, Germ. bate, llic.⁸ In the Latin liber the labial alone re-

maius.
