. Throngbont the Latin verb we may observa, as in the case
of cro here, that the elementi bas vanished from the first person
01 the future3 100 ero does not really differ from eoum, the
present indicative. The explanation of this may be derived from
the fact, thatin English the first and the other persons 01 the
tutare belong to different forms: where an Englishman says, “I
shall'' 01 himself, he addresses another with “you will;'’ and‘

been shown elsewhere that in these langnages, the same root is
used 10 express ‚“light,'’ 00 “brigbtness‚” and “ speaking” (Nera

festation,” or “ bringing to light,'' and this ie simply the idea 01
“ making,” or “ causing to be.'’ Now the 1011 form 01 the root
