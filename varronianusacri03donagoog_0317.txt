between c and u, which was marked by the addition of atail to·
the old character o, the letter thus modified being used to repre·
sent the mediat, and the old form being transferred from the
medials to the tenues. The author of this change was sp. Gar-
vilius, a frcedman and namesake of the celebrated Sp. Carvilius
Ruga, who, in A. U. 0:523, Β. c. 231, furnishod the first example
of a divorce. See Plutarch, Qaaert. Rom. p. 277 D: τὸ Κ πρὸς

γαμετὴν ἐκβαλόντος. From the position in the alphabet assigned ·

to this new character,-namely, the seventh place, conesponding
to that of the Greek a,-there is reason to believe that the
Roman c still retained the hard p-sound, while the new charae·
ter represented the soft palatal pronunciation of the EnglishJ
arrd thc Greek z, which is also expressed by the modern Italian
ρι’. It is clear that the Greek K was introduced long before the
time of Carvilius, and therefore there could have been no need
of an additional character except for the expression of an addi· ‚
tional souud. And aa K was used only in the syllable ka, the
additional sound must have been that borne by c and u in
modern Italian before the vowels Ε and 1. Before 0 and U, aa
we shall see directly, Q was in its original place.

Τοο Latin rr was a strong guttural aspirata, corresponding
in position and in power to the Greek χ’. It is true that this
character sometimes indicates a mere optritae caper ,· and in this
uec it is either dropt or prefixed, according to the articulation.
In general, however, it was the strongest and purest of the
Roman aspirated gutturals. Graff has remarked (Attandt
Berl. Ar. 1839, p. 12) that there are three ⁴classes of aspiratos-
the guttural (rt), te. the apirr'tae; the labial (w), ι’. ο. theflataa,·
and the dental (s), ι’. ι. the cibitatua: and he says that the Latin
language entirely warte the first, whereas it possessae the labial
aspirato in its Q, and the dental perhaps in its x. This appears
to me to be neither a clear nor a correct statement With regard
to Η in particular, there can be no doubt that it is a strong gut-
, tural, quite as much so as the Greek χ. This is established by
the following comparison. The Iatin rr answers ιοχ in the
