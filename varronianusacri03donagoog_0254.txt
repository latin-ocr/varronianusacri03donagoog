difficulty (above, p. 23). It would be admitted at once that, if the
Ratione and Rasena were one and the same peopla, some foreign
interferenoe must have disturbed tha continuity of their area iu
the valley of the Po, aud if there was once an unbroken stream
of population hom the Lech to the Tiber, no ethnographer will
doubt that its source must have been in the mainland rather than
in the peninsula. But it has not been sufficiently considered, that
tho bullr of the Pelasgian nation, already settled in Umbria and
Etruria, would net lose their original type, merely because they
were invaded aud conquered by a band of warriora hom the
north, any more than Aegle-Saron England was entirely do·
prived of its former characteristics by the Norman inroad. The
civilisation of the Tyrrhenians, their connexion with the commer-
cial activity of the Mediterranean1, and the advantnges which
they derived from the arta and social culture of their brethren in
Asia Minor (above, p. 39), were circumstances long anterior to
the invasion from tho north3 and as the Rasena would adopt the
retinements which they found among the Tyrrhenians, we may
make ingenious comparisons betium the tombs of Porsena and
Alyattes⁸, without refusing our assent to tho well-attested fact
that the warriors and city-nobles of historical Etruria derived
their origin from the Ruetian Alps. With regard to the argument
hom the tamaius of the Etruscan language, the philologer will
at oneo admit that, as far as it goes, the evidenoes of affinity,
which havc been adduoed, are neither precarious nor doubtful.
Instead of conjectures founded ou a caaual agreement of syllables,
we bava seen that the meaning, which we wera led to expect,
