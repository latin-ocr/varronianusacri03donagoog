’ Although these general resulta are already established, the
details of the subject have not yet been sufficiently examined,
especially as regards the fragments ef the language spoken hy

remarhed before, it is always eaaier to perceive resemblances than
to recognize distinctions3 and the ancient writers spealr of 'Phra-
