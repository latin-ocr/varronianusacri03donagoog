'in inscriptions just as ξύν govems the dative-locative in Greek3
thus we have oum quam or cam quen (Censen, 1. p. 268).

§ 2. donarat sedente of tlte ocae-Minya.

In treating of the Latin cases, our attention is 'directed to

three different aspecta under which they may be considered.
'We may regard them either according to a general scheme de-
rived from all the declensions‚ or· as modified by those varieties
in the termination of the crude form which constitute differences
of declension; or we may take both of these together, and add
to them those additional phenomena which are furnished by the

adverb. A supplementary source of information respecting the ,

cases may be derived from those noune, whether substantive or
adjective, which are obviously formed from the oblique cases of
other noune. Thus, we know that the original Greek genitive
ended in -cao (Sanscr. aya) from the form of the possessive ad·
jective δημόσιος (Bopp‚ Verql. Gramm. p. 294, note). Similarly,
acase in, dne, analogous to the Senserit instrumental‚ may be
inferred both from tlre particle aine and from the derivative forms
arbdoaa (= arbritatus), tre, and officim (affictione), &e

If we confine ourselvcs to the forms of the noun, wc get thc
following general scheme of the case-endings.

the different cases attach themselves to the different charac-
