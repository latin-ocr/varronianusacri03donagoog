hitherto eluded etymological analysis.

. 'l'he Tana-th was the most easterly of Scythian, and iudam
ol European rivers. The explanation of the name is implied in
· what has been already stated. No difficulty can arise from the
appearance of a tenuis instead of the medial‚ which generally
appears in the first part of this name3 ior the Danube, which is
most consistently spelt with the medial, is called the lira—owe iu
the Ith'ebelaaqaa-liad (v. 6116). The Tanais seems to hare been
thesame river which the Goasacks still call the Doaoetz or
Yoaoeta. κ r
' We find the word Dana-a in composition not only with tha f
synonyma Ia·, Ap, Poris, and Ter, but also with aaa, which
occurs in the names of the Asiatio A-rc-aas, and in that of the

Rha, or Wolyc. Thus, we have the Eri-danus in Italy, the ,
Rho-docus in Prussia, the Rho-donas in Franco, and the name g

‘Pori-dou, quoted by Ptolemy. In England the name Doaa
occurs hy itaelf aa “the Doa.”

ᾗ 11. Names ⁰f the Scythica divinitis.

Let us now pass to the names of the Scythian gods, which
may be referred without any difficulty to the roots of the Indo-
Germanic family of languages. Herodotus informs us (lv. 59),
that the names by which the Scythians designated the Greek
divinities, Ἱστίη, Ζεύς, Γῆ, Ἀπόλλων, Οὐρανίη Ἀφροδίτη, and
Ποσειδέων, were Ταβιτιξ Παπαῖος, Ἀπία, Οἰτόσυρος, Ἀρτίρν
uraca, and flammam and it is clear, from his manner of

speaking of these and the Medo-Persian divinitiea (1. 131), that '

he ia deacribing one and the same elementary worship.

Ἱστίη, or Vasta, was the goddess of firc, as Ovid tella us
(Fert. Ἦ. 291); “nec tu aliud Vectem quam oa'oom intellige
flammam.’' There can be no doubt why the Medo-Scythicus
called her Tacui, when we know thatin the Zend and Senserit
languages the root tah- or tap- signifies “to burn.” Compara
also the Latin tad-eo, tegridus, the Greek τῖφ-ος, the German
thau-ea, the new Persian tebtdca, Solavonian teplye, whence

« Toepla’tz, “the hot baths,” and the river Tepel at Karlsbad,

the anan tetram (Tala Apron. vv. 17, 20), Etruso. tepla-cl
