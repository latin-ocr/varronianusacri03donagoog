With rogard to the legend that Minerva sprang from the head

³ of Jupiter, it is 10 be remarked that the head was considered tc

be' the seat of the mena, as the heart was of the animus,-
whereas the 001100 (Lucret. 111. 354) 0011011110 corpore tot0‚,is
diffused all over the frama, and has no special seat assigned 10 11.
With regard then to the opposition 01011111 and coimus, the
English antithesis of “head” and “ heert” sufficiently expresses
it. See Ter. Andr. 1. 1, 137.

Itis easy to explain the names Saturnus, Vertumnus, Mara,
and Ferocem, from the elementa of the Latin langusge. 811100-
0111 --· Κρόνος is connected with soe-calum, as (11110111 with 110001
(the full form being ‹eoi-teram, Varro, L. L. VI. ἓ 11), sempi-

ternaa with semper, and wei-turnus with taceo. Vertumnus is
the old participle of vertor, “Itum 01 change myself.” (see
Oh. 111.§5.) Mara is simply “the male'’ or “menly god.”
Thus Mae-piteris “the male or generating father.” The forms
Mar-rw, Ida-mariue exhibit the root with an intensive redu·
plication3 the root is strengthened by t, denoting personality‚ in
Mar[t]s‚· and the words Ma·oor[t]s‚ Mc-mer[t]s give us both
the intensive reduplication and the strengthening affix (consen,
20111110. f 11091.190011852,ρ.31). In this 1101111110 ideaof viri·
lity is connected with that of protectior, and the root is identical
with the Greek lap, Sanscr. ert, “ to protect‚'’ 0100, “1 man,‘’
Latin cir, dcc. (New Orat. 5285). It has been proposed by Pott
(Etym. Forsclr. 11. 206) 10 connect maa with the Senserit root 01011
“to think,” from whence comes macas “the mind,'' manuehya
“ man ;” and we know that this root vvith these connected mean·
ings runs througha great number of languages: thus we have the
Egyptian men ‘⁴ to construet or establish,” mouth “a man,” the
Greek μέμονα, μηνύω, dcc, the Latin enon-eo, 01001101, merra,
1100101, the German calceamenti, &c.; and this brings us ,
back to the goddess Mimo, and other mythologieal beings, as
Mena, Menas, Minoa, Minyas, and 11001101 (Q. R. cnv. p. 149).

We may aleo remark that the Hebrew Ἶξξ 10001111111110111101]
connected with ᾫξο10011111. But here the idea is somewhat
different For the verb Ἥ contains the 1001 lcar which islound
in the Chald. ’ὈἼ and 53, and signifies inflyer, 1010011111,
hence tropically memoriae inflpere, imprimere, (nant, 00000111.
