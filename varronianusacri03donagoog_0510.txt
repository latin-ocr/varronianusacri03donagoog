As the nonns in -ttb[a] must be regarded as formed 110111
the genitive of the abstract substantives in semes, we may
conclude from the similar signification of noune in -ta[t]a and
-tu[t]s, thet they are formatione from the ablatives ol' the same
sort of noune, and as piapatdo--piaqatd-a‘ae is an extension 01 a
noun formed 110111 the ablativo 01 prinpach, we may infer that

noune like forti-ta-clo are similarly formed from nonne like Κ

vir-tus=ot'r-tu·[t]s=oir·tod·s.

, As nouns in sio, dre. denote the action, so we find that,
with the affix r, the same termination implies the agent Thus,
besides some abbreviated forms in which the t appears nneffected
by any addition to distinguish it from the third pronominal ele-
ment‚ as pcc-ter, maye-ter, minis-ter, hut which the Greek forms
in 11111,οε πει-τήρ, show to have belonged to the same class
with the abstraet nouns in -tsh=-tyea, we have a large class 01
words in -tor, lem. -tr-ior‚ denoting the agent. Thus, from
μου-1101110 go before,'' we have paeonem-ar, “one ‘who
goes „before” i. e. “a general'’ or “leader,” and from this egain
is formed pre-turo, denoting his agenoy, function, or office, and
poemerium, the place which is appropriated to him. The verbal
natine 01 these adjuncts is shown by the lact that they ere inti·
mately connected with certain perticipial forms. Thus, from
acribo, we have the supine or infinitive seraptem, “to write,’'
end the participle serap-tants, ‘⁴ about to write‚” as well as the
nouns emp-tor, ‘⁴ a writer,” and scrip-tora, “ e writing.‘’ And

ifwe compare these with the participle (E. ΙΙΙ.) reip-has, “writ- j
ten,'' we shall see the differenoe between the forms under dis· ¹

cnesion and those which involve merely the dental affin 01 the
third pronominal clement. For the latter imply only an object
-a thing done-while those before us denote that the agentis
still at work, and referto the act 01 doing. Extenuated forms,
like mageb-ter, dre, ere sometimes lengthened in their deriva-
tives, ae mageb-teriam, dm, which revive the original type. But

very often the r is immediately appended to the t in the nenter ’

derivatives‚ so that we seem to heve nothing more than the
combination which appears in the third numeral, the eompara-
tive suffix, end the preposition 110110 (above, p. 392). But the
analogy 01 the other endings end the meaning of the words
plead for the connexion of the objective nouns in -trum with the
