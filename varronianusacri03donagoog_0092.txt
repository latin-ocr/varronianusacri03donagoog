on the other hand, the Oeltoan'anian tribes were overrun or
⁴ absorbed at a very early period by successive or parallel streame
of Sclavonians, Lithuanians, and Saxo-Gotho, flowing freely and
freshly from the north of Iran; and the latest of these enigmata,
the High-Germans‚ found many traces of similarity in the Celtic
tribes with which they ultimately came in contact. Whatever
might have been the degradation of the Ugro-'lhrranian races in
those regions where they were most thinly scattered‚ it is obvious
that the Scythicos Herodotus, which was the highway of the
earliest march of Indo-Germanic migration into Europe, could
not hare boen, aa Niebuhr supposed, mainly peopled by a
'l'chndie or Mongolian stoclr. And though the name of S-oolotoe
or Aac· eaba, by which some of the Scythae called themselves,
may be regarded as pointing to a Celtic or lbranian intermixtum,
the great mass of the hordea which dwelt to the north of the
Euxine must have consisted of Indo-Germanic tribes who con·
quered or ejected the Turanians; and I have no hesitation in
referring these invaders, together with the Pelasgians of Graece
and Italy, to different branches of the sclavoniae, Lithuanian,
Saxo-Gothic, or generally Low Iranian stock.

It has been proved that the Sarmatians belonged to the parent
stock of the Sclavonians; and we find in the Sclavonian dialects
ample illustratione of those general principles by which the Scy·
thian languages seem to have been characterized. Making, then,
a fresh start from this point, we shall find an amusing number of
coincidences between the Sclavonian languages and the Pelas-
gian clement of Greek and Latin: most of these have been
pointed out elsewhere¹; at present it is only necessary to call
attention to the fact. So that, whichever way we look at it, we
shall find new reasons for considering the Pelasg'ans as a braneh
of the great Sarmatian or Sclavonian race. The Thracians,
Getae, Scythae, and Sauromata, were so many links in along
chain connecting the Pelasgians with Media; the Sauromata
were at least in part Sclavonians; and the Pelasgian language,
