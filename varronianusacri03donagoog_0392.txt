apronoun referring to the nominative of the verb, we employ
, the reciproca] or reflexive se. Thus, although debella-t is a suf-
ficient expression of “ he said, or used to say‚'’ wc must introduce
ee before an infinitive expressing the assertion; as: debebo-t ss
cese bonum vebum, “he said that he (the person, in question,
who said) was s good man ;’' aud as we should write eqo
diceba-m Mu esse, or tu dicebare ‘rs esse, we may infer au ori·
ginal pronoun of the third person beginning with e· and corre·
sponding to the Greek ὁ or ἵ, just as ἑ corresponds to se But
tlris form occurs only in the oblique cases, sai, sabi, se, and in the
particles si-o, siae, ei, und ee-d.

The original inflexione of the two personal pronouns were as

follows :

N. epo or gomet ta or tre-te
G. moe ιε’-ε

D. rei-hi (for oni-fi or oni-bo) ries·

A. one-te

Abl. one-d

For the plural, or rather the collective form, of the personal
pronouns, we heve two different roots corresponding to νῶῑ and
σφῶϊ, which ere used ss the duel in Greek; end from these

ero-bi-s. According to the analogy of νῶῖν, σφῶϊν, we ought also
to have genitivos noum or nomm, and oro-um or veram. But
these ere not found. Indeed, although the singular genitivos
mes, teir, which may have been originally forms in jors, like
boias, e-jue dec, retained their use as late as Plautus, these slso
became obsolete in classical Latinity‚ and the genitive forms sor
the singular and plural were derived from the possessive adjec-
tives meus, tous, nos-ter, ves-ter. The connexion between the
genitive end the epithet is well known (Nero Crat. 5 298),
and in all languages the possessive may take the place of the
genitive of e pronoun. But in Latin and Greek we have not
only a possessive in direct adjectival agreement with its noun,
but, by a singular attraction‚ we have the genitive of the pos-
sessive used es if it were the genitive of the pronouu itself. Ι
call this en attraction‚ for I think it must be explained by a
transition from those idiomatic collocatione, in which adcpendent
