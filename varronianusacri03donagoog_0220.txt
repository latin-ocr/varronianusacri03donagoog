0111001111, and Anna as the goddess of the moon3 and as she
recurred throughout the period of the sun’s course, she was
further designated by the epithet perenna. To this Anno
perenna, “the ever-circling moon,'’ the ancients dedicated the
ides of March, the first full moon of the primitive year, and,
as Macrobius tells us (saram. 1. 12), “eodem quoque mense
et publice et privatim ad Annona Perennem sacrificatum itur
ut annai-c perennarcqac commode liceat.'' The idea, therefore,
attached 10 101 1101110 was that of a regular flowing, of a con-

It is, perhaps, worth mentioning that in a Tuscum monument
