From this it appears that odra represents the son or daughter
as opposed to the father, the mother’s name being given in the
matronymio.

The other of the two words in'this inscription, to which I
have adverted‚ is pilares, which clearly means donarium, or
something of the kind. This word, as we shall see direcssy,
occurs on a number of small Etruscan objects, which are of tha

the donation. Now we know from Festus (p. 230, eseli, 109)
that ploro aud imploro or endophro in old Latin signified in-
clamo without any notion of lamentation or weeping. If, then,
we compare the Icelandicflet'ri, Soio-Gothicflere with the Latin
plures πρῖε-στω, we shall easily see how phlerea may contain the
same root as ploro =pleoro (below, Oh.x11.§2), especially since
the Latin language recognizes a similar change in fleo compared
with plac. The word is then in effect equivalent to the Greek
ἀνάθημα, as in Cicero (adAttic.1. l): “Hermathena tua valde
me delectat, et posita ita belle est ut totum gymnasium ἡλίου
ἀνάθημα esse videatur.'' Thus it means a votive offering‚ like
the votiva tabella of the ancient templea or the voto of the
