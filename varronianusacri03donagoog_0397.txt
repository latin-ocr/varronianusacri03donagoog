found in the Sanscrit aa, sola, ao, and in the Umbrian aso, dic,
where thera is an initial vowel as in ἐμέ, compared with μέ,
was still extant in 'the days of Ennius, who writes saec, sapsa,
sum, aaa. The guttural appears without any lsbial affection in
the affix ·c· or -ca, and in the forms cair, citro, ceteri, &a The
forms ahta'oi-rae, illici-raa, Ιιίοἰ-ηο, tucci-nc, show that α’ is an
older form of tha affer thau aa, and tha inscription of Aquila has
even the sorm besai (Cornan, 1. p. 271). As there is reason to
believe that the first syllable of tha Umbrian aso is a residuum
ol the second pronominal alemant fa, analogous to the i in i-a,
dte, tha form asaele (above, p. 102) is really a combinationes
three. as lai-c is of two similar elementa. The Latin forms ado,
ajo, epo (Now Orat. ς 134) might lead us to inser that laia may
originally have been eti-casae. As the first alemant, in
this repetition os cognate syllables, was generally omitted in
Latin, so we find that tha final -c was dropt in the usual form of
the genitive lapus, though hujusce oaeasionally appears, and
was usually omitted in tha pluual, with tha exception of the nom„
accus, voc. neuter taam, though good writers have occa·
sionally lai-c for lsa‘ (Varro, L. L. v1. 73), and lace-c for ho (Plaut.
nalal. 111. 5, 593 Tar. Ειιπ. 111. ὅ, 34; Pliorm. v. 8, 23, dccl,
in the nom. masc. and iem. The neuter brac fumishas us with

y the clue to some important analogias.

If there is good reason to connect lai-c=a·lvi-c with the
Umbriam eas-lc, thereis still more reason for secking an affinity
between tha second indicative prououn ris-ta and the Umbrian
astu. The latter combination will not allow us to doubt that
the final syllable is identiaal with the second personal pronoun.

Its adjectival inflexion in three gandera is a subsequcnt result of .

its usage. But thera is no reason to conclude that the forms
-ta'us, tt (for -ιῶἢ, -tcm, -το, are not as original as tais, riht and ta.
Tha identity of the first part of asu-lc or εἷλκέ-ο and catu, as in·
dicatives of the first and second prononna is supported hythe
Habrew ’handlad “ I,'¹ and ’lca-tlh ’tar-ta, “thou’' which arc
similarly distinguished by the affix only. And such forms as
eqo-m, ἐ-’γώ-νη, Sauscrit a-laam, show that the syllables e-yo,
abacto, doc, do not in themselves indicate the first person,
though they strongly exhibit tha idea of naarnesa as opposed to
that ol all other positions. But although -c is the distinction
