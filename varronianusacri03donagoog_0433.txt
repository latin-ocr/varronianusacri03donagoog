analogous to the adverbs in -ter (leci-ter, gnavi-ter, dre), or -tc'm
(fimana, dre.) (Now Oratylac, ξ 365, above, p. 343). In fact,
the isolatcd particle igi-tra supplies a perfect analogy for the
passive person-endings -utr and -ntaa This particle, as we
have seen (above, pp. 342, 401), is· an extensior in -tar from the
composite form r'aya' (cl. e-yo, er-yo(-o), c-ho, aja), and it has the
locative meaning “ thereup0n” in a Fragment of the ΧΗ. Tables
(above, p. 242). We have also seen that the sdverbs in -tcr,
tim are used in a locative sense. And whether we conclude
that -tur is a locative like τόθι, or identical with -tuc = -θεν, and
therefore bearing a locative meaning only as the actos separation
implies proximity at the moment oi ¹separation (above, p. 397),
there can be no doubt that it does bear that locative sense, which-
is required by the personeudings of the passive voice. The
identity ot' -tar with -τον (tim) is farther shown hythe form
omem, which stands by the eide ol anta-tur, and the change
from the short ὅ tc a, is found in other cases, ay. in traharcrho
from treber and in teritur-aus and dictur-nus bym the side of
haarnac. According to this, the first persons amor and amo-
mar are contractioris ot* emeretr, amombatr, according to the
Sansuit analogy (comp. bbere with φέρομαι, dre. Nero Oret.
§§352, 362). The second persons, amurca (amore) and amc-
caini, are altogether different forms ; 'they seem to be two verbals,
or participial nouus, of the same kind respectivaly as the Latin
and Greek active infinitiva, amarc=cmoac (compare dic-aa's-ae,
mae, Gr. γέλαῐς, ipah, dte), and the passive participle rmrrd-
μενος. The verbal, which stands for the'eecond person singular
of the passivo verb, was probably, in the first instance, a verba]
noun in aaa compare πρᾶξις, nimy-cac, dcc. That which re·
presente the second person plural is the plural of a form which
isos very frequent occurrence in the Latin language (tv'ew Orat. .
5362). The earlier form ended in enitor, and is preserved in
the imperative, which in old Latin had a corresponding second
person singular in anino: thus we have ontcstcmino (Lcyy. ΧΗ.
