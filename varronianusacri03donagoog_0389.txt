ever, rsa means a merc object of thought, a thing which is or
may be handled; and this appears still more clearly from the
use of rc-or,“I think,’‘ i. e. “I propose a res to my mind,” and W„ ·
its derivati a ra-tr'o (from rra-tua), which implies the actiones
the verb, and denotes the mode or act of thinking. Stin, it may
bc seen, by a little care in the examination, that the fixed or
passive meaning efres is quite consistent with its original use as
a noun of action. As we shall see, when we corne to the penn-
cls'c and gerandino, the differenoe between active and passive
becomes evanescent when we descend to the infinitive or abstract
use of a word. When we are speaking of the “ winding·np oi a
business,” “the closing of a shop,'' dc, it is obvious that we
direct attention to the thing done, rather than to the act of doing
it. Just so with res as opposed to ratio. Between these two the
substantive reus and the verb reor may be presumed to inter·
vene. If res means a “ handling,” or “action'' reas will denote
the person implicated in the action; and as rea, in a legal sense,
denotas the cause and object of the controversy, in the same
technical application reta will denote a person aeensed or im-
peached-cujcs res agitur. And as ratri> has no existence save
through the verb reor, it must mean something more than the
mere bodily handling implied by res. It must denote a mental
operation consequent upon this contact. And, in point of fact,
ratio always implies some intellecturi process, or the plan and
system which emanate from it. While rea or res familiaris is
the property, ratio is the account kept ; respublica is the state or
object ol government, ratri> 'is the mode of goveming3 rea is the
enter world, as in patara rmum, dcc, catab is the inner reason,
which deals with it theoretically. And this opposition is even
carried so far that, while cadmum ratio is the arrangement ol
words, or the style (Cic. dc Oratore, 11. 15, ξ 64), we have
reum ratio (ᾗ 63) for “histery,” or the arrangement of facts
and actions.

The neuters in e of this declension are interesting as examples
of the form which appears by the side of all masculine and
feminine adjectives in easaetenatone. Of course this
theory assurcs us that the original ending of their neuter must
have been -id, just as aab was originally catil. And this
inference is confirmed by an obsoleta neuter in -ds, which bears
