passive in their use as paradica, are really only secondsry
forms of the participle in -o[t]a, appears not only from etymo·
logical consideratione (Now Orat. 5415), but also from their
use both as active infinitivcs and active participles. When the
gerundivum is apparently passive, it seems to attach to itself tho
sense ol duty or oblc'ycttba. Thus, wc should translate delendo
ert Carthago, “Carthage is to be destroyed '’.=“ we ought to
destroy Carthagc;” and no one has taken the trouble to inquire
whether this oportet is really conmined in the paeradisum. Il
it is, all attempts at explanation must be unavailing. But since
it is not necessary to seek in the participial form this notion,
which may bc conveyed by the substantive verb (eg. sapientia
est saprum cosae), it is surely better to connect the gerundivum
with the yeuradticm, and to reconcile the nse of the one with the
ordinary force of the other. Supposing, therefore, that widuc

¹ is a seoondary form ol da-a[t]s, and synonymous with it, on the
analogy ol Acrcyc[at]a, Amiqo-atum orm[t]a‚ oria-adm
διας how do we get the phrase deado est omae, “an oppor-
tunity is to be given,'' from wuda = daa[t]a, “giving ”t
Simply from the gerundial or infinitivo use of the participle.
Thus, (A) do-odua=da-a[t]a significa “giving;” (s) this, used
as an infinitive, still retains its active signification, t'or ad
dan-dom opos means “ for giving riches’'=“to give riches;‘’ ·
(c) when this is attracted into the case ol the object, the sense
is not altered, lor od opos dandus is precisely equivalent to od ’
&adum opoa,· (n) when, however, this attraction appears in the
nominative case, the error at once takes root, and no one is
willing to sec that it is still merely an attraction from the iu·
finitive or indeclinable use ol the participle. Even here, how·
ever, the intransitive verb euables us to bring back the student
to a consideration of the real principle. For one can hardly fail
to see that &wadum eat =. civem cst i. q. oporte oica& and that
there may bo no doubt as to the identity of the uninflected with
the inflected gerund in this case, Horace has put them together
in the same sentence: “nunc est bibendam, nunc pede libero
pulsanda tellus,¹’ where it is obvious that tellao pulsando ert is

, no less equivalent to “oportet pulsare tellurem,’' thau “biben-
dum est ’' is to “oportet bibere.” At all events, his Greek origi.
