, of “ vow‚” “prayer,’' “ invocation,” “ offering‚'‘ may be repre-
sented by such an object. Accordingly the inscription of the
lumel-crowned Apollo will signify: Sum votivum donarium
Apollrirs' utque Artarns'di; Fortia Rustic, Tasci stlte, faciundum
curavit. For if we compare ceco with cecbaae or cecdosc, we
may render it with reference to the Icelandic kasa, Danish
boloma, “to heap up” or “burla” The same word cacto im·
mediately follows clas in an inscription running down the right

. leg of the statne of a boy in the Museum at Leyden, which

is aa follows (Lauri, 11. 5333 Mioali, Aerati edocumenti, pl.

³ 43; nares, naman, uo. ron: wezatraawaaaz stupratas

Africa Acnoohe cleu cerba turbineo renotat. Stenb reuders ..

this: “ Velius Fanacnal [vovit] aegri pueri causa sanata aegri· ’
tudine.'’ The latter part of this inscription must of course
be compared with that on the statue of Metellus, commonly
called the animatore, in the gallery at Florence (Dempster,
Etruria Regalis, Τ. 1. pl. 403 Miiller, Dochmo'ler, No. 2893
Vermiglioli, pp. 35 sqq.; Minati, Antiati Moauwaentr', pl. 44, n. 2),
which is as follows: Actori Metelsb Vc. Vesicl clausi cerr ptores
foce sonci terrine tutbfnca obsistite Steub's rendering is: “Auli
Metelli V. V. filii causa donum dedit Sansl Tenine sanato vul·
nerc.’' Iu both cases his conjectures seem to have little probabi-
lity. If Steub is right in his analysis of coolclra (above, p. 129),
chastres ought also to bea numeral, and if so, there would he
a similar presumption respecting tlcnacbcia in the other inscrip-
tion. But it is idle to indulge in such conjectures. All that
can be said with any confidence is that in each of the inscriptione
the last two words are parallel expressions in an absolute case,
probably the genitive singular, explaining the cause or motive
of the offering, and that with the exception of the verb cacha in
the Leydeu inscription, and the words carr pblorea tace in that on
the statue of Metellus, the remaining words are proper names or
persona} designatione. That teca is a verb (wc may compare the
Old Norae take, which has several applicable meanings), and
that cen pilares tace Sonat Tacina probably means “ hoc donarium
obtulit Sansilina Teniua‚” may be inferred from the fact that these
words nearly constitute the whole inscription on thc right thigh
of a bullam stom, formerly in the Museo Gratiani, which differs
from that at Ireyden only in the fact that the boy is sitting instead
