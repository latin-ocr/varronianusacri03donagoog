The parallelism between qaa'ppe= qui-pte (comp. ψῆφον-ι
ipmpte, Festus, p. 105), end dre entitles us to conclude that .
utpote, which is all bnt asynonym of quippe, is merely a
componnd of at and a form equivalcnt to the termination -pte
discmsed above. And as it cannot be proved that et pota=
et potest in Varro (apud Non. c. 2, n.¹ 876: vipct, cegat, at pote
plurimum), there is really no evidence to show that pote is a
neuter adjective, and that ut pote means “ as ie possible.'‘
Tha suggestion of Doderlein that it stands for ut puto does
not deservo s moment's consideration.

That quilibet involves the impersonsl libet is obvious on the
slightest examination3 and notwithstanding the difficulty occa·
sioned hythe particle ee, we must conclude that the and pers.
sing. of vole is the affix of quietis. This is not only deducible
from the analogy of quilebet, but is shown by a passage in Cato
(R. R. c. 52), where a nonnis interposed between qua‘ and vr‘a:
“ hoc modo qnod genus aas propagabis.”

What has been already said of cun-qua = cum-que = rra-re
applies to other uses of the affix -que, as puraeque, uter-que,
andi-que, atriu-que, ubi-que, capue, queo-que. There is much
general trnth in Schmidt's definition of quiaque (depranam. Gr.
etLat.p.100): “pronomen indefinitum rem mente conceptam
et ererum ejusdem generis cumulo ac serie exemptam significat.
Que autem particula si ad pronomen additur, pronominis vis ex-
tenditur, idque sd omnem rem, in quam cadere possit sententia,
transferri significatur. Itaque quis, particula que adjuncta, non
hominnm incertum quendam, sed omnem, ad quem pertinere pos·
eit sententia, notat. Ab munch igitur ita differt, ut hoc quidem
cunctos simul significet, qunque autem distributionem quandam
exprimat.’' Referring to the comparison made above between
the Roman affix, and the Greek, -κα, κεν, or ἄν appended to re·
latives in general expressions, it is clear that the only principle,
which will explain all the facts, ie that which lies at the basis
of the true theory respecting these Greek particles. Now it
appears that ἄν and κεν are connected with the second pronominal
clement, and therefore claim the same pedigree as the relative
prononns. Bnt they are not only immediately attached to the
relative word in the hypothesis or protasis, as in ὅταν, ἐάν, ὃς
