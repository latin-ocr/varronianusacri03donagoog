The analogy of aaa shows how it would have been written
had it become a trochee; the same is shown by the Greek accentu·
ation, for we have Γάϊος not rator. The original form ol the word
was Gauius, probably signifying laetificam cf. panthea (Anfrecht
Zet'taclr. f. carpi, Spr. 1. 232). The 0 has boen retained as the
initial from the time when there was no distinction between Gand
0,· but the word was always pronounced Gaiae,- and it seems
that it should be ao written, except when the initial onlyis used.

Although the vocative, as a distinct case, is thus limited
to a few forms in the language‚ the Latin writers give it ocea-
sionally a very remarkable extension of use. Thus it is made

· to agree with the nominative ta: aa

Stemmata quod Tuaen ramum milletune ducis,
Censorem fatuum vel quod trabeata salutas.
(Perv.1n.2'l‚28).

This is regularly the case in the idiomatic use of macteamaqr's
aucte (he. fruqt‘bua et mohs); thus we have macte virtute aa,
“be increased in virtue‘’ (Hor. 1. Serm. 11. 31); macta nond
uirtute puer, “be increaaed in your young valour'’ (V rrg AEn.
lx. 641). And even in an oblique sentence, as jaderam [te]
macte virtute aare (Liv. 11. 12).

If now we add to the observatione derived from tbe actual
cases of noune, the additional phenomena furnished hythe ad·
verbs, the subjectos this chapter will have received all the
examination of which it is capable.

Adverbs are, properly speaking, certain cases of pronouns
and nouus, and under particular circumstances they are doduoed
from the participles or supinas of verbs. Their syntectical nseis
as secondary medicatas, iuasmuch as they convey predication
only through the verb of the sentence. The Greeks employ their
adjectivae and participles for this purpose without any additional

inflexion; but the Roman adverbs are always casea and some- '
times, if one may use the expression, double or superimposed ἵ

casea of nominal or pronominal forms.

Pronominal adverbs are secondary predicates either of plaoe
or of time. The former indicate-(a) “locality,'’ in which ease ,
they generally exhibit the locative audinga -br' aud —r'm or the
