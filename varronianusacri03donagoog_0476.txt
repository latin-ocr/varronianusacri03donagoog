have lor their characteristic the letter i considered as a semi-
oonsonant, or vocaliaation ol a guttural, has been already given
(§1). With regard to their origin and analysis, we must eon-
sider the former as an extension of the -a conjugation, and while
the vowel-verbs in -a‘o will thus represent a set of derivativas
in which a crude form in -a'is strengthened by the affix -ya,
in which ease there will always be a connection, the semi-conso·
nantel verbs, which outwardly resemble them, merely strengthen
the present and its immediate offspriug with a vocalized guttural,
to which the person-endings are attached without any iuter·
mediate agency. Thus, as we shall see in the next chapter, all
verbs of the third conjugation are derived from nonus actually
existing in λ, or which may be inferred from the inflexione of
existing nouns, while the semi-consonant verbs have no such
primitives. We see the manner in which the second conjugation
is included in the third, from arerb of the seeond conjugation, of
which the root happens to end in the vowel -ί, and which, there-
fore, is liable to the double connection observable in all genuine
ί verbs. From the root οι·- (Greek ἐί-ω) we have, with eu
entire correspondenoe of meaning, two forms cieo and σι’-ο, and
as the perfect is always otei, we must consider the latter as
a condensation of the former. The great peculiarity of this
verb is that its participle (E. ΙΙΙ.) is indifferently citas or dtus,
⁸the latter being found not only in compounds like correitus,
incitus, percitae, but also in the simple form citam, both when it
is used as a participle, as in Virgil (AEneid. vl11. 642):

Haud procul inde eitra Mettum ln diversa quadriga
Detulerunt,

where we must take cite with in dionae, “chariore moved in ‹lif-
ferent directione ;'’ and also when it appears as a simple adjective
signiiying “swistss' The short penultima is contrary to all mle;
for the participle of σι’-ω must be ci-nus=aus ‚- and we can only
explain it as the result of Roman abbreviation (cf. veto, otto).
But the existence of the forms cieo and oio is quite sufficient to
prove the fact, for which I contend, that true verbs in -i include
the formative in -ε, And in the next chapter Ι shall show thal,
as Ι have mentioned above (ὅ 1), the same remark applies also
tethea verbs. To this rule, respecting the iverbs, there arc
