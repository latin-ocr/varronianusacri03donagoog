· As the Romans successively conquered the different nations

’ which formed the population oi Italy, they gradually included

within the limite of a singleempire a number of different tribes,
who spoke idioms, or dialecto, differing bnt little from the lan-
gusgc of the Romans themselves. It is not, therefore, surprising
that a gradual amalgamation should hare taken place, and thet·
every Italian should have spoken, with only slight variatione of
aceent, one and the same Latin langnaga. The langusge of
Rome itself—the language of governmcnt, of literature, and cf
law-would, of course, be independent of these minor differences.
Every educated man end every public functionary would refer
to this unvarying standard, and would speaker write, in some
cases with pedentic accuracy‚ tha langoage citha senate-house
and the foruml. Accordingly, tbc inhabitants of the provinces,
- i. c. the foreign subjecta of the Empire, would hear nothing but
pure Roman Latin ; andis they learned the language oi their
rulers at all, they would at least learn it in the best form.-
Their position in this respect differad materially from that ot
colonists, even in ancient times. The oolonistsof our day, and
especially the English emigrante, present a material eontrast to,
the case oi the Roman provinciale For, while the colonists who·
sailed from Corinth or Athens were of all classes-oi rigberto-
our modern colonists are generally those who are either not able
tolive at boine, or, at all events, who practise trades inconsistent
with a high amount of educational polish. We find, therefore,¹
that colonial English represents only the vulgar colloquial lan-
guage of tha mother-country3 whereas the Roman provinciale
spolie a language derived-imperfectly, it might be, bnt still
derived-from the polishcd and elegant diction of proconsule,
jurisconsulto, negotiatores, and publicani. ⁴

The Gauls, in particular, were remarkable for their tendancy
to assimilate themselves, in their language and usages, to ,the
Romans. In an inoonccivably short space of time the province·
Gallia was completely Romanized². Their own language was
