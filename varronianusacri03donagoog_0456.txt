“ following‚’' but κονίη-ε’* having followed.'’ The same is the
distinction between morihn[t]a‚ wwriusdrrsr maha[t]a, mimda,-
iroocea[t]r‚ ira[s]cuudue,· dvc, on the one hand, and miuus,
cruca iratae, duc, on the other. This cannot be remarked in
active verbs, because the Latin language has no active past par-
ticiple¹. If, however, we turn to the gerundial use of the form

in -adoe, wc may observe a distinction of tense between it and p

the participle in -tue even in the case of active verbs. Thus

soluendus is really a present tense in Virgil,AEneid.1x.l: =

volvendo decr, err, aualit ultro; comp, Ennius (apud Varro, L. L.
vn. § 104, p. 160, Miller), and Lucretius, v. 1275; because,

the following passages show that tho gerund is equivalent to the
present participles Virgil, Geory. 11. 225: “multa virum colueris
durando saecula vincit;’' Lucret. 1. 203: “multaque vivendo
vitalia vincere saecla;’‘ and id. 111. 961: “omnia si pergas oi-
oeado vincere saecla.” And the words os Livy (pref. ud Hirt.):
“quae ante conditum coaderadomve urbem traduntur,” can only
mean “traditione derived from a period when the city was nei-
· ther built nor buihir'ap.’‘

ξ 14. Tio Particrple ὄπ etim·

The participle (y) in m or eno, which always beares
future signification, is supported by an analogy in the Latin lan-
guage which has no parallel either in Greek or Senserit The
Greek desiderative is formed from the ordinary future hythe
insertion of the clement εἱς thus δρά-ω, fut δρά-σω, desiderative
δρα-σείω. This desiderative is the common future in Sanscrit;
though the Vedas have a future, like the Greek, formed hythe
element e· only, without the addition of ί· (Rosen³ on the Rip·

Vide Sentice, p. iv.) Now the regular future of acribo would be ξ

scrip-ao, indicated by the aorist serpe& but the desiderative is

Α ἢ sompturio. We may infer, then, that in the loss of the regular

¹ Oonddcrotur tom (cio. Ossan. 1. i 1) seems to be an example to

the contrary, and tho words metm, circumspectus, worm, solaro, meiius,
oe. have a quui-active meaning. just ss conversely true deponent puti-

ciples are used ss passivos (see Lubker, ds participiis, p. 29).
