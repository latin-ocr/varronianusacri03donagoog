aa confictore dobree “to represa or keep down sorrows” (Cic.
ttae. Drep. v. 31).

The first point, which strikes the philological student, when
he turns his attention to the second conjugation, is the general
tendency to drop the characteristic e in the perfect (A. ΙΙΙ.), and
its participle (E. HL). This is necessarily the case in all verbs
which take the proper pe'rfect (a) by reduplication, as mordeo,
mmnordi, moretm or the aorist in ·ei, (β), as judeo, joasi, jaceres,-
layco, larci, lactum and when l or r· precedes a guttural in these
verba, this guttura] is omitted in tha perfect, as in firlpeo, fol-ai,-
terquw, ιον-οὺ and the same is the case with dentale, whether
muta or liquid, as ridw, reci,- haereo, toea· though moneo
retains its n in the perfect mansi. But even where the agglu-
tinate perfect in -ce' is used, we generally find that the charac-
teristic e is dropt before it. indeed there are onlya few cases
in which the perfect is formed after the analogy of ama-ei.
These are deleo, deleoi,· fleo, Μ· neo, ceoi,· the compounds
of oleo, as cholen, oboleoi,· the compounds of pleo, as impleo,
impleoi,· and the nearly obsolete vieo, oe'cci. The longe in
these verbs is generally retained in E. ΙΙΙ., aa deletus, fletae, im·
pletue; bnt adoles has adultus, and aboleo makes abolitus. All
other verbs of thia conjugation, which take the agglutinate per·
fect, omit before it the characteristic a, and either drop it also
in the participle Ε. ΙΙΙ., or shorten it into f. Thus we have
moneo, monui, masaa ,- mhceo, mebcui, meatem and ms'octua.
The deponent reor takes the stronger vowel a in its participle
rdtoa whence rdtrb, bnt the iis resumed in the componnd
{memnon rotae. Verba ending in o generally absorb the o
of their agglutinate perfect like the corresponding a verbs joco
and lco0,· thus wc have cocco, ccci, cautua,· faveo, scivi, finctus,-
soveo, joci, setam moveo, mcci, neom,- paveo, pdci; voveo,
voci, voco. If wa compare mordeo, momordi, morare with
prandeo, pandi, passaw sedeo, sedi, sesam and video, vadi,
ciam we shall probably conclude that the latter have merely
lost their reduplication. The best explanation, which can bc
offered of the very general evanescence of the characteristic e
