have been iveri or ‹iv-nl: ἀμφί. Moreover ἐπί and ἀμφί con·
our not only in their ordinary meanings, but especiallyin that
sense of interchange or reciprocity which Ι have claimed for ert
(Nero Orat. §174). Now oh, which resembles tho Senserit cohi
in its Amlaot, shows by its vowel the lest trace of e lost nasah
comp. obbo, unedo, dnsscffl. And its usage, in other sensas than
thet of propter, indicates a close connexion in meaning with ἐπί
end ἀμφί. Thus opte'mus from oh manifestly denotes “ up-moffl
or “upper-most.’' So thet ob must heve denoted “ superpositicn”
or “relative altitude’ like ἐπί. And Festus (p. 17 8, Miiller) has
pointed out useges in which it concurs with the two Greek pre-
positions: “ob praepositio alias ponitur pro circem (ic. ἀμφί),
ut oum dicimus urbem obsideri, ob-oalbzrs', obss’yners' .. . alias
pro od (ie. ert) ponitur, ut Ennius: ob Εωηανη nocte ἰῳὼω
duone coepit, et olibi ob Trcy’am ducit.'' The relative altitude
implied by ἐπί and ob is shown in such phrases as ob oeulos
“before the eyes‚'’ i. e. on a level with them3 end in Ennius'

oea, where the compound reminds us os AEschyl. Olco'eph. 350:

ἐπι-στρεπτὰ αἰών. The frequentative sense of ἐπί is conveyed
by obeo, ἐπιφοιτάω, “to go buckwards end forwerds,” and the

relative height of o table, or city built on the level surfsee of e l

hill, is signified by oppidum= ἐπίπεδον (Virg. Georq. 11. 156:
tot oonyeste mano prereptos oppida sones). The phrases quoted
by Festus for the sense of circum romind us at once of ἐπί and
περί or ἀμφί. Thus obsedere is either ἐφέζεσθαι or wsptmdricdue
If obscum reminds us oi ἐπίσκιος, we have ἅμφικαλύπτω in
