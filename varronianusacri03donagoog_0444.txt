the Hehrew conjugatione in Pelet and Hr‘prh'lsl. Sometimes
the canmtive sense refers to the object, as in arcesso, “I cause

is reflexive, as in the conjugation Hispanae· thus, we have

Most of the tenses of the Latin vowel-verb seem to be com·
posite forms of the same kind with those to which I have just
referred3 and the complete verbal inflexion, to which the crude
form of the particular verb is prefixed, is no other than a tense
of the verb of existence Jir, Lithuan. bre, Senserit hle (see
Bopp‚ Verpl. (fremorem Arctet pp. ir. and 804). This verb, '
ss we have seen, expresses “beginning of being,” or “coming
into being,” like the Greek ιγὺγνομαι. It is therefore well cel·

culated to perform the functione of an auxilisry in the relation of ¹

time. For amc-dcmmm-e-ficm‘q became to love,’' “ Iwas
loving;‘’ ama-ho= cora-fic = “I am coming into love,”·--“I am
aboutto love;’' amoci=cmo=swi=“l have come into love,”
= “I have·loved,” &c

The vowel-verb has a present tense which preserves through·
ont the vowel of the crude form. From this is derived, with
the addition of the elementi, the present subjunctive, as it is
called3 and from that, by the insertion of r-, the imperfect of the
same mood. Thus we heve cm2m= ommim, amorem= ommes
=ama·sa·im; mmmmm-pam, monerem=monescm=mone=
qam, dre. That ί was the characteristic of the secondary or
dependent mood is clear from the old forms dudm (dt'm), ternpus*-
