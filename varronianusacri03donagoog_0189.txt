must refer the names of the personages¹, which are known to
have been adopted byNovius, Afranius, and Pomponius, andwhich
are either Greek in themselves or translations of Greek words.
The old gentleman or pantaloon was called Poppae or Oaaaar:
the former was the Greek Πάππος, the latter, as we have seen,
was an Oscan term :vesta The clown or chatterbox was called
Bucco, from bacca, and was thus a representative of the Greek
Γνάθων. The glutton Macco, Greek Μάκκω, has leit a traco
of his name in the Neapolitau Maccarona',· and Puach or Poli-
chz'ncllo is derived from the endearing diminutive Prrlohellaa
which, like the Greek Καλλίας, was used to denote apes and
puppets¹. The Suasio is the σάννᾰς of Cratinus (Fr. locat.
xxxnl. a. p. 187, Meineke); and this buffoon with his patch-
work dress is represented by thc modern Harlequin, one of
whose names is still auaui, Angl. “irony'’ The modern word
harlcquia is merely the Italian citocatiae, i. e. “ gourmand.”
Menage's dream about the comedim, who was so called in the
reign of Heury III. because he frequented the house of M. de
Harlai, is only an amusing example of that which was called
etymology not many ysam ago.

On the whole we must conclude, that the Atellan farces
were ultimately Grecized, like all the literature of ancient Italy,
and as the language of the Doric chorus grew more and more
identical with that ol the Attio dialogus, to which it scrved as
au interlude, so this once Ossan modium was assimilated in
language and character to the histrionia plays, to which it served
as au afterpiece‚ and so gradually lost its national character and
aoeial respectability. Thus we find in the destiny of this branch
of Osoan literature an example of the absorbing centralisation of
Rome, which, spreading its metropolitan Latinity over the pro-
vinces, eventually annihilated, or incorporated and blended with
its civic elementa, all the distinctiva peculiarities of the allied or

subject population.
