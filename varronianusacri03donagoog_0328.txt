into eoa), where the N is represented by a long pronunciation of
the preceding vowel, as appears from the Greek transcription
κῶνσουλ (Corssen, 1. p. 101); and we lind ceeor, iosos, m'cr‘es,
cicestram lor censor, infans, videre, mecoeamar (see Oorssen,1.
p. 30 b). Similarly a is elided, especially before s. Thus we
have in old Latin adeam sor edeam, prosus for prorm (as in
prosa ονοιίο), rosas for rursus (Mtiller od Fert. p. 25). We have
even secem-josum for saraam deornm in later Latin (see Jourrtal
ofPltilohryy, March 1858, p. 200). This omission of rt is regu·
lar in the Greek particles in -eac, and in other words, e. g. ὀδούςς
it seems also ιο have been the rnle in Umbriae. As the Greeks
wrote -rrc for the Latin os, so conversely the Romans wrote thea-
coemeter the Greek θησαυρός1 (Murro, Jourml of Philoloyy,
Feb. 1860, p. 283). This scemate show that a befores was
merelya nasal sound, which lengthened the preceding vowel.
In the Romanos language the Latin tennination -enath generally
loses iton (see Schneider, i. 2, p. 458). Thus we have Vendere
by the side of Watdnnn boarqeoh for beryermk, coartatis for cor-
tenaia, dec. In Italian we have Veroaece for Veronensis, merchant
for marchense's, poeee for propensior and the last two pass into the

. French marqaia'andpoga, The most important instance of the

omission of s before v is fnrnished by the common word οοηιίο,

derived from mecentio through the ferm corenam, which is
found in old inscriptions (see Senot. Getta. de Boeo. 22). Sini-

Ι. luly, movete becomes eooeot (“ cover-garden, dms), Confla-

eetes is turned into Oobleoa, and satas into “five'' In English
the prefix eoa is shortened into co· before all consonante, in spite
of the remonstrances of Bentley. On the contractione of eoa in
Latin, see Lachmann on Lucret. 11. 1061.
