diately formed lium the root οἱ, “to go,” as in the case of nite
t-a, ιηίῑιιὶιο, οι is directly derived from some other verb, as iu
the case of ροο-ο-ο, pov-idue, pou-dte. That the shorter form
in -ιο may be regarded as merely an abbreviation of that in eto,
may be inserted from the constant omission of ἶ in such cases as
copo, conto, perpe, dic. force-1⁸90, co-imo, per-repo, dic. (above,
p. 459 note), and this view is sustained by the interesting verb
op-to, apparently s shortened form of ola-tto, “to go frequently
about an object, to applyoneselfto it” (cf. capto). For the form
. we may compare op-timus from the preposition ob, and we have
perhaps au anelcgous meaning in the Greek φίλος, φιλέω,
which probably contain the root of wit-vulsas, πελ-ἄξω, πέλο-
rae, doc, and implythe eager approach of interest aud affection.
The verbs in -ὅ·ν[ο]ο have also a frequentative meaning, as may ·
be seen from 22tcr[a]o, “to go over and over again,’' which has ·
furnished a name for the class just discussed. But it is not
necessary to consider these verbs in ·e·r[a]o as derived from
other verbs, except so far as the nouus from which they spring
are of verbal extraction. They are all built on the foundation
of nouus in s=r, and perhaps they always presumo that this
letter represents au original dental, so that the noun is as regu·
larly neuter as the noun which lesda to the frequentative in
-ι[ο]ο is regularly masculine. Thus iter-e eomes from deq ‹19-
per-o comes from uppem temper-o cernes from tempus, temper-rm
ouer-o comes οοιω, orer-rb, dcc. When we esnnot find a corre-
sponding noun under this neuter form, we may infer it from col-
latersl consideratione. Thus moder-o, compared with madri-or,
pelte-rdu, dvc. suggests an objective word corresponding ιο
1⁴er,oe a correlative to the noun of agency modus. Then,
again, toler-o, which has no corresponding noun, leads us mtu-
relly ιο a form analogous ιο τέλος, dolus, and signifying “a
thing taken up‚,’' or “ a load;’' cf. oues and ouem with ae-dalo.
We are confirmed in the belief that these verbs in -ro come from Ἴ
objective forms in νει, by the fact that we have also derivatives

l · from the nouus of agency, which affix this letter to the t=d

mentioned abovc; thus we find such verbs aspere-tro of the first
conjugatiou, the terminatiou of the future participle, which is

=' originally identical with that of the nouus of agency in -tor

(above, pp. 427, 486), being here shortened, as in mine-or by
