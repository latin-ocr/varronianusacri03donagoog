Taking cleu or clun hy itself‚ there ere etymologiccl arguments
for both conclusione. On the one hand it may be remerked,
that the root, which in the Greek end Latin lengusges signifies
dead, summu, top, is cel, cul, ott, κολ-, cop, or xpo. These
ere in effect the seme root—compare flisco, cresco, &c.; and it is
well known, thet words denoting height end elevation-or head-
ehdp, in fect—ere employed to signify rank. Now the transition
from this to primogenitum-the being first in e family—is easy
end natural: compare the “patrio princepe dontret nomine

regem” of Lucretius (1. 88). Therefore, ifclen or elene (in Latin
’ clano or clanim) is connected with the root ol celeus, cul-rnen,
collo, clivus, κολοφών, κορυφή, κύριος, κοίρανος, κοῦρος, κόρος,
κύρβας, κράνιον, dec, it may well be used to signify the first in s
family. Of. the Hehrew triph, “de cujuscunque rei initio,
principio, origine (velut flumineo), summitate, velut de montium
oerte'ct'bwr, &c.” (Fttrst', Oonc. sn). To this it may he added
that there were two rivers in Italy which bore the neme of
ohne or¹ ahaim theone running into the Tiber between
Tuder and Volcirrr'e', the other joining the see near the Tuscan
colony of Vulturnum. Now the names of rivers in the Pelasgien
lengnage seem to have some connexion with roots signifying
“height'’ “hill” or “hill-tower.” This hes been indicated
ebore in what hes been said ol the names of the Scythien rivers
(Ohep. 11. ᾗ 10). The Tum-the “Tuscus river,'' es the
Latin poets cell it-scems to heve derived its neme from the
Pelasgien teba, “e hill,” end the root rr', “to flow” (sce above,
Ohep.1v.§2). And the (Ihm-ris end Chiro-ius, which flow
down from the Apennines‚ may well heve gained e neme of
similar import. On the other hand, we shall find thet the most
obvious result from en examinetion of the northern lengueges
isin favour of the supposition, thet clere either signifies “ little’'
ee opposed to “ greot‚’⁸ or “son” es opposed to “lethes'' For
though the root tt in lelifi leli e, klerffi signifies altitude end
climbing, end though kladcr in Icelendic denotes “a roek,” we
find thet, with the affin n, klen or klien in Icelcndic, end in
Germ. klcire, signily “little'' but primarily‘ in the sense of “a
