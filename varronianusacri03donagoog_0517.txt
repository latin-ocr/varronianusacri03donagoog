the country ol the Romani. The permanence ol this rule of ,
secondary derivation is shown by the practice of our bishops,
who call themselves antcorrbnsab, Daadmanaab, dcc, to sh‘ow
that they are temporary incumbente, rather than hereditary
pecrs. ,
A comparison of these uouns with the equivalcnt Greek
forms in cor-m, adme, φης, tcachcs us that the termination
-sis, attached to the locutive -cn and belonging to the second
clement, is identical with the similarly derived -mc We shall
therelorenot he surprised to find it also under the forms -ta'a
and cer. This is the fact when the locative‚ to which it is
attached, is plural, as in the case of those nouns, which express
an extendcd region rather than a definite locality. As we say,
ὄπ cyris, ia campis, in silvie t'n terris, rather than c'n cyro, in
compo, dre, it is natural that we should find, as we do, cyres-
tc'a, campen-ter, sylves-ter, error-ter, rather than ‹tyren-arb, dic,
which do not occur. At first sight we might feel disposed to
refer epatre-tor and pedes-ter, ratberto the substantives marca,
pedes, than to the locatives equos pedibcoe. But the omission of
bin queris for quibam, dcc, shows us how pcdcab might be a loce·
tive, and we have a passage in Virgil, which actually places the
locutive equis on a parallel footing with the derived peden=
ped-r't-s5 AEhteid v11. 624:

Pars pedor [i. e. padebat iens] ire perat campis: pars amum ultis ·
Pulrcrulentur spata furit: omues arma requirunt

The noun aequm-ter does not belong to this class. As de
‚ noting a functionary, it connects itself at once with mepta-ter
and micis-ter, and es these involve adverbs, which are of the

nature of locatives, we must darive ceques-ter, not from sepnor .

with the old grammarians (for then we ought to have sanctor),
but from cemw=ceqcrsss (cf. scqctbr.) εέκας, and thus sequester,
which means a mediator, umpirc, or other indifferent party, will
naturally imply onc who stands apart from both the litigants3 t'or
quod aecus est is opposed to qaod interam (Plautus, Tria. 1. 2, 93).

The patronymica in -ilias must not he referred to the same
class with the nonns in -c'lo, -mcs, crica, &c As it is known
thatin this case ti=di (compare Acilius, Epidius, Hostilius,
Petilius, Pompilius, Popilius, Vehilius, with their original forms
