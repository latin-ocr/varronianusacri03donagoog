So long as it merely lisps the irrartieulate utteranoes of half—
eduested men, it has no hold upon the hesrts of those who
speak it, and it is readily neglected or thrown sside iu favour of
the more cultivated idiom, which, while it finds names for luriu-
riesof civilisation before unknown, also opens a eommunieation
with those who appear as the heralds'of moral and intellectusl
regeneration. ,The Greeks and the Jews had good reasons for
leving the language of their ancestors, and oould never be in·
duced to forget or relinquish the flowing rhythmo of their poets
or the noble energyol their prose-writers. The oese was not so

tions, and with a mobility of eharaeter which still distinguishes
their modern representatives, they speedily adopted the manners
and, the words of the Romans; and it is probable thatin the
time of the Empire there was no more differenee between the
grammatieal Latin of Lyonsand Rome, than there is now be-
tween the grammatieal Freneh of St Petersburg and Paris.

·’ From what ,Ι have just said, it should appear that the Latin
spoken in Gaul was upon the whole better and purer than the
Latin spoken in the municipal districts of Italy during the time
of theEmpire. Let us, however, suppose that they were only
equally good. Then, if it ean be shown that the disturbing
eauses were greater and more efficaciaus in Italy than in Gaul,
we shall still have a greater 'surplus of good Latinity in the
latter.
