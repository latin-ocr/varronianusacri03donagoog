The Scythiam of Herodotus are represented as oocupying
the wide tract of country which lies to the north of the Euxine. l
Thongh there are some alleged differences, we can collect that
the whole country between Media and the Danube was occupied
hya series of cognate tribes. The earliest traditione represent
these Scythiam as in continual contact and collision with the
Medes; and we receive many significant hints that the Scythiam
and Medea were ultimately connected with one another as
kindred races. If we pnrsue this subject in its details, especially
as illustrated by the fragments of the Scythian languagc which
Herodotus and others have preserved, we shall see that the
Pelasgians may be traced step by step to a primary settlement
in Media or northern Irhn.

The general proof that Intn, or the country lying between
the Caspian, the Euphrates, the Indian Ocean, and the Indus,
was the original abode of the Indo-Germanic race, has been
given elsewhere¹. It has also been shown, that within these
limite were spoken two great branchos ol the one Indo-Ger·
manic language, which stood related to one another in much the
same way as the Low and High German3 the former being the

. older, and spoken by the inhabitants of Media, the northern
half of this district. To these Medea, or, ss they may he called,
the Northem and Low Iroaa'cne, we refer, on the one hand,
the Iliadae, who -call themselves Ariana (dryas, ‘⁴ well-born''),
for this was also the ancient name of the Medes; and, on the
other hand, the following members ol the Sclavenian and Low
German familiesz-(o) the &mace or Serranam, an old
