just ns δαίμωνεδαίμοψς differs from χείμωνεχείμων-ς, or as
aalma arolam differs from σπλήνι- cathrin-c. In some of tha
nouus in s=r this characteristic represents the neuter t,· such
ere oea, gen. (eris, raes, gen. ruris, os, gen. orei, cer, gen. oens,
&c Other noune in r really belong to the a' declcnsion, as
laquem, gen. laqueariis. But we have a large number of mas·
culina and feminine nouus of which r is the genuine unam»
istic. These are formed in -ἔν, or -ω, or -us, ese, as mdia,
Ceres, Vanum in -r'rr or os, -ὃνίθ, as ἱαόον, stoan in -ur, chri, aa
aequm in -atr=·ua‚ -urrh, as tellum in -cr, ’ὄπ-ὡ, as arbor: wc
heve an important class of noune denoting agency, and ending
in -tar, cris, as per-ter, nro-ter, irc, to which must be added
uter, carth, venter, aen-tris, and the compounrl occepi-tar (ent) .
from compto: cf. capys, the Etruscan word for a falcon (abore,
p. 184). The instrumental ending in -tcr is extended, in every
numerous class of nouus, to -tor, -tore's, assibilatetl tc -εον, aare ,-
thus wc have ductor from duc-o, (ινα-εον from cro, monitor
from moneo, spon-sor from spondeo, &c We have seen that the
r often appears as s in the nominative3 in two nouus an eis
changed into ι’ in this case-thus wc have aas, οίπὸνὺ and
pulcra paletria In consonantal derivativas from nouus in r, as
in the conespontling neuter-forms, this characteristic is retained·
asa simple sibilant3 thus, from Venus„ Veneni, we have venua
tuor from honor, Ῑιοπῦνὼ, imeae-tau from orbor, arbitres arbus-

(a) Nonne in iexhibit some phenomenc of considerable
linguistic importunae, which have eluded the observation of all
previous grammarians. It has hcen shown elsewhere that thc
termination ι’, as a guttural residuum, is derived from the second
pronominal clement. But it appears as an extension not only
of other ¹pronominal affixcs, but even oi the second pronoun in
many of its forms, and especially under the form c=k. Thus
we have not only a large class of Greek adjectives in -κός, and
nouns in -κ-ς, but we have also the extensione -κ-ις, -rc-eoc, llic,
in which that clement isrepeeted under a soitened or vocaliaed
form. Similarly in Latin, although the substantivas in :cao-s or
