§4- (a) roma otoo oe oo eminerammi ono.

There arc comparatively few Latin noune in ·mo or caua,
which ’express an action as immediately proceeding from the
subject: such are farra, “a speaking'' (root fa), flamma,
“a bruning’' (root flag), tra-ma, “a drawing’' (root trah-l,
antonno, “a blowing‚’' armoe, “ a joining,’' remae (root rct- or
, rot-J “a turning round’' (in the vater), i. e. “a rowing thing‚’'
abacos, “ a nourisher,’' pri-onoc, “the first of a serice beginning
with the subject‚” duc.

ᾖ 5. (b) Formo with tle second Pronominal Element only.

The second clement, under one or other of ite various modi·
ficatione, contributas most largely to the formation of derivative
noune. A great number of these are abstract or qualitative ·
“ terma, and they differ from those in -rnc and enas by their
more general and relative predication. For all those formed by
the first clement only may be translated as exoressing the snb·
ject of action, and some of them, as remur, almus, cannot be
regarded as mere abstractione. Whereas the nonna, which
exhibit the second element as their termination, always depart
from the idea of a subject or agent, and express only an agency
or quality, like the English words in orceo, -tood, χιχ, dcc. Some·
times the second clement appears under a guttural form, aa in
ooo-a (voa), “a voice'' or ‘⁴ speaking'’ (Sanscr. loe, cf. βοή, ἠ-χῆ,
dcc.); and to this class belongs the copious list of adjectivae in
cao, -i·ooa‚ ‹rc-o (= aa), dre, denoting quality or disposition, as
civi-mos from aaa, omi-cua from coto, loquo-or from loqaor, &a
But by far the most common form of the second clement, in its
use ae an affix, is that in which the guttural ie vocalized to i.
Besides the numerous words in ·c'c‚ das, eo, eus, eam, ab, as
grat-ic from gratae mod-ius from arod-as, prb-w from pria,
ὃαῐο-οω from calo-s, consilium from conoul, febr-ia from serraco,
salmanche-rb from πυόο, Μαιοηᾏεετηαιεν-ἁι-ιὶ from mater, dec,
it se'crns reasonable to infer that the masculine noune in a, toge-
ther vith some femininae, involve vocaliaed gutturalc3 for ve
