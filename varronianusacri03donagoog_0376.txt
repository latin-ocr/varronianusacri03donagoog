, It has been already remathad, that noune of the third decien-
sion are arranged according to the nature ol' the characteristic
consonant, which precedes the ease-ending3 and that they fall
into two great classes according ae they retain the consonant or
vocalize it into r'or a. The characteristic is very often lost in
the nominative singular, but it may always be recovered by a
careful examination of the oblique cases. '

tenuis c is a more common characteristic than the medial 9. Of

the latter class we have only the primitive frua &atq-l, pree
