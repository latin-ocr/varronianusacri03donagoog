fixed geoden and without eny copule, to express pessive predi·

§3. Doctrine of the Latin Teretes.

There is, perhaps, no one department of classicel philology,
in which so little has been done es in the analysis and simplifica
tion of the Latin tenses. They ere still arranged end designated

es they were in the beginning; end no one seems to have dis-
cerned the glering errore insepereble from such s system. Even

among the more enrightened, it is not yet agreed whether certain
tenses arcto be referred to the indicative or to the subjunctive
mood, end forms of entirely different origin are placed together
in the same cetegory.

Withcut anticipating the discussion of the difficulties which
beset the doctrine of the Letin tenses, Ι will premise thet, prse-
tically‚ the regular verb hes four moods end five tenses, which
erc known hythe following names, end represented, in my
Gremmar, by the notation attached to the terminology; the ia·

’ debetive (A), imperative (B), subjunctive (C), end infim'tive (D)
moode, end the present (I), empcrfirt (II), perfiet (III), plaper-

fhct (IV), end fictore (V) tenses. Thus, to avoid repeating the
names, Δ. ΙΙΙ. will represent the perfect indebetioe Ο. Π. the
imperfict rehjenctioe, and so on.

An accurate examination of all the forms in the Latin len-
guage will convince us that there ere only two ways in which
a tense can be formed orgsnieelly from the root of a Latin verb.
One is, by the addition of ως the other, by the addition of i».
We find the seme process in the Greek verb3 but there itis
regular and systematic, supplying us throughout with e complete

series of primary end secondary, or definite end indefinite tenses& ’

In Greek, we say that the additiones σ- to the root forms the
sorist and future, thet the same adjunot in a more guttural fonn
