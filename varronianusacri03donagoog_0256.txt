by an aristocracy of conquest, was not permanently influential,
but was ahsorhed, like the Norman French in this country, by
the Pelasgo-Umbrian language oi the bulk of the population, the
latter, which may he termed ‘⁴ the common Etmscan,’' like the
Sabello-Oscan and other dialects, mcrgcd in the old Latin, not
because the languages were unlike, but because they were sister
idioms, and embraced one another assoon as they had discovered
their relatiouship¹. The only way to escape from all the diffi-
culties of this subject is to suppose that the city on the Tiber
served aa a centre and rallying point for the languages of Italy
as wellas for the different tribes who spoke them, and that
Rome admitted within her walls, with au inferior franchise, which
in time completed itself, both the citizens and the rocabulan‘es
’ of the conquered Italian states. 'If this absorbing centralisation
could so thoroughly Latinize the Celtic inhabitants of Lombardy,
and even the transalpinc branch of the Gallio racc, much mora
would it be likely to atiect the Etruscans, who extended to the
Tiber, and whose langiuage, in ita predominant or Pelasgian
character, approximated so closely to tho cognate idiom of the
old Latin tn‘bes. ·

¹ Among many instances oi the possibility at least ot such a cambion,
not the least interesting is the derivation oi Populonia from Ptuplum,
the Etnrscau Bacchum so that this city, the Etruscan namo oi which was
Popluna, is the Dionysopolis oi Etruria (see Gerhard in the Eleia. Mas.

for 1833, p. 135). Neritis cloarthatas Netturrs=thtuuua ia the ι ’

god of aethra, so Phupluas=Poplaaus is the god of pepla. It scema that
the ancianis planted the poplar chiefly on account of their unas, and tha
poplar was sacred to Hercules, who has so many points of contact with
Bacchus. Have we not, then, in the word ptcplrms tho root otpopurm, a
word quite inexplicabla from the Latin language alone? A sort oi ,
young, effeminate Hercules, who appears ou tho coins of Populonia (seo
Mulier, Errat. 1. p. 331), is probably this Poplumu. Tha differente
iu the quantity oi the first syllables of Populea and Pdputom'c is not
surprising‚ as the latter is an exotio proper namo, aud the former a na-
turalizad common term.
