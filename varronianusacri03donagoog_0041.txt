Τυρσηνόι significa “tener-builder,’' and that this term has been
properly explained even hy Dionysius¹, as referring to the
τύρσεις or Cyclopem fortifications which every where attest

, the presence of Pelasgian wwer-huikiera. The word τύῤῥις or

τύρσις, which occurs in Pindar aa the name of the great palace
of the primeval god Satum², is identical with the Latin tuwsk;
and the fact, that the Pelasgians derived their distinguishing
epithet from ‘this word, is remarkable, not only as showing the
affinity between the Greek and Latin languages on the one hand,
and the Pelasgian in Etruria on the other hand, but also because .
these colossal structuras are always found wherever the Pelas-

gians make their appearance in Graece. Fortresses in Pelasgian¹
countrics received their designation aa often from these τύρσεις
as from the name Ιιανιοιο, which seems to signily the abode of
the lars or ρνύιοο. . Thus the old Pelasgian Argos had two
citadels or ἀκροπόλεις, the ene called the Lernaea, the other
τὸ ἄργος, ι’. ο. the σοι’. In the neighbourhood, however, was
the city Tiryne, which is still remarkable lor ita gigantic
Cyclopean remains, and in the name os which we may recognize

existiug combinationes Tyrrheno-Pelasgian and Umbrian ingrediente.
We aro indebted to this scholarios some of the most important contri·
hutions which Italian philology has ever received. ln his treatise on
the Eugnbine Tables, which he published in the year 1833, as an exercise
for his degree, ho evinced an artent oi knowledge, sn accuracy oi
schelsrship, and a maturity of judgrnent, such as we rarely meet with
in so young a man. His collection ci Umbriae and Oscan inscriptions
(Lipsiae, 1841) supplied the greatest want felt by those who were
interested in the old langusges of Italy. And the most fruitful results
have proceeded from those inquiries into the Egyptian language and
history in which he has long been engaged.
