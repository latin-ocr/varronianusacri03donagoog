’ tesiphon, by a name compounded of the Celtic Apso (Aomrl and
the word ria, which we have just examincd The first part of
the word occurs also in the name of the river Hypo-coria, which
means the water of Coria. The root cf the second part oi this
name appears iu the names of the city Gar-cine, and the river
Germ, which flowed into the Gor-cicilia ainus hythe sumu

' mouth as the Hyperi-rh ancl Hypo-coria. It would also seem that
the exceedingly corrupted name Pan-ticcpes began originally
with the same word: the meaning of the last three syllables is
absolutely lost, and they will scarcely be sought in the modern
name Iapeti-etc, of which we can only say that the last syllable
representa the root sir·; comp. Tana-ir, Tana-etz ¹.

The Greeks who dwelt near the mouth oi the great river
Borysthorea naturally pronounced the native name oi tha river
iu the manner most convenient tc their own articulati0u; aud
the name, as it stands, is tc all outward appearance a Greek
word. This circumstance has deceived the ablest of modern
geographus, who derives the first part of the word from Βορῆς
or Βορέας. There is little difficulty, however, in showing that the
name is identical with that hy which the river is known at the
present tima—the Dnicper or Dona-parri, with the last part
of which we may compare the name Parata or Rern. It is well
known that the northern Greeks were in the habitos substituting
the medial, not only for the tennis, but even for the aspiratc3

for θανεῖν, aud etampes for Φόσ-φορος. Accordingly, their
pronunciation of the word⁴ Dona-parri (=Parr'r-daouc) would be
nam-tare, or, by an interchange of the two synonymous

· elementa, Barth-danos& But the Greek ear was so familiar
with the sequence σθ-, that the ad· would inevitably fall into this
collocatiou3 and. with a change of vowels, for the same purpose
of giving the barbarous name a Greek scund, the compound
