a' and a may be traced to an ultimate identity with gutturel or
labial mutes, it· is clear that the nouus of which they are the
characteristica ought to be ranged among tha consonant declen-
sions. In this way we shall have two main classes of nonus-
those whose characteristic is one of the pure-vowels a or ο,
and these may be considered as subdivided into two declensions3
——and those whose characteristic is aoonsonant‚ whether mute,
or liquid, or one of the semi-consonante iand a, considered as a
representative of some mute, and these may be regarded aa
constituting one declensiou. While this scheme of the declensions
is the only arrangement which can be justified on the grounds
of scientitio etymology, it is at least aa convenient as any other
to the mere learuer: for we cannot give any practical rnle to a
beginner more simple than that which results from thia arrange·
ment-namely, that the vowel-nouus invariably form their geni-
tive plural in -wam or -o-rrorn‚ which is rarely eontracted into
-ams that they form their dative and ablative plural in -ἱο,
which rarely appears under the uncoutracted form -baa .· that
the accusative singular is always -arn or -am, the accusative
plural -οε or -oa, and the ablativo singular always -d or -ὂ ,· and,
on the other hand, that the consonant-nonna generally form their
genitive plural in am, which is rarely preceded by the character·
istic r ,- that, conversely, they form their dative and ablativa plural
in -bua, which rarely, if ever, loses its characteristic b,· that the
ablativa singular is always e or ir and the accusative plural
always -ea‚ except when the characteristic isa. These general
distinctions do not apply to the nominative-accusative plnralof
neuter nouus, which are uniformly terminated by -ἅ iu all declen-
siona If then the classification‚ which Ι am about to' explain, is
not only true, but most convenient to the student, there can be
no reason why it should not supersede the old-fashioued method
even iu elementary grammars.
