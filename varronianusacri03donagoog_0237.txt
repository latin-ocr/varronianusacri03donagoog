synonymous words wc have tha Teutonic root paor, qncr (Lat.
quenl “to grean or grieve” (Grati, maaca 1v. 679), by the
side of manaan, suevo=dolor (Graii, vu), Old Engl. sor,
New Engl. sonora Old Norse coer. Or if, instead of this, which
appears to me the most natural supposition, we endeavour to
unite the two words in one fonn, we must have reeourse to the
idea ol prostration and lying in the grave, and hero the Ioelandic
gives us the verb thoma ε aaut, delapsam, the adjective
theeri· = transversus, and its adverb tbverz=trauaoeraim (vid. Edd.
&mana Vol. 11. Spar. Glocs. pp. 859, sab). Audin the cognate
languages we find the same change in this word ae might ba
assumed in the coer and aver of the Etruscans: for while the
Icelandic tdocrr, Engl. ttwart, Dan. tver, Germ. awerclt, exhibit
the dental more or less assibilated as in socr, the German quer
and English quar give us a guttural instead oi a sibilant as in
ever. The forms of thoma, when passive, are ek ttverr, thvarr,
tisorias ,· when active, ele tloerra, enada.- and thurr, thart,
tityi-rina, signify “aridus’' “sicana'' like the German dura.
Withont stopping to ask whether these latter forms are derived
in any way from the verb thvcrr, which is quite possible, it is
worthy of remark that in those sepulchral inscriptions, in which
the word coer or aver does not occur, we have, in corresponding
places, the word theare, tharaci (Vermigl. p. 118, ed. 2), thorae,
thasra, thamni (laser. Per. ll. 6, 20, 41). And in one old
epitaph (lanai, Sappio, 11. p. 97, no. 12) we finde mi anthi L.
Felthurr', tlara, where the position of the last word almost leads
us to render it: “I am the lamentation ior L. Felthurius
deceased? The inierence derivable from the appearance of these
forms is that either synonymous words expressive oi grief and
sorrow or connected words significant of decay, prostrah'on, and
death, and liable to the same modification, probaMy existed both
in Old Norse and in Etruscan. The amount of probability

depende upon the cumulative effect of the other evidence². But

¹ Imay mention in passing that ruer actually occurs in Runic inscrip-
tions in thesemo “rather-ih·raw;” thus: iflir Kattritr· ruer rin (Die-
samaraei-sprot. p. 265)’; aad that 1 do not regard this armore than
an accidental coincidence with the expressions under consideration. For
aaa· is the corrupted form of the (ioth. rwoiiro, Germ. mtwieper, Lat.

mear, (ir. r'aenpor, Sanscr. eraquro.
