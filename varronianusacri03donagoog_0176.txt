tei, just as pte-f (Tae. Pomp. xxrv. 4, 3) snswers te e-bi. For
poe’aed Anheeht (us.) suggests pam oeae. If peiaad is to
stand, it must bes subjunctive corresponding to posset, a form
of pendo The analogyis supported by the Freneh poids for
pendae, dre. Lt'yed οὼῙοοπ leye hae, just ss below, l. 25, es
esbken ἰὴιζο must mean ee hebes lepidae. It is hardly possible to
understand kemtom.en.exeept as an abbreviation ottho two
words meatem mem, the latter being the saum pronoun whieh
appears in Latin, in the loeative ease, ss the eonjunetien mim,
Senserit tna (Now Orat. ξ 170). Grotelend's supposition that it

Kmonm=u eoseum. This, to say the least, requires to be
supported by examples. The verb lcehnust ·-·· hetnuemt is every
diffienlt word Mommsen (p. 269) proposes to eonneet it with
the Gothic quimus “to eeme,’' so that kebnust=ebemoet Aul·
reeht, who jnstly objeets te this etymology (u. s. p. 190), sug-
gests a eonnexion with the Senserit pop == jurare. It appears te
me that the first syllable is the root ei sep-ut, κεφ-άλη, haupt,
dee so thot led-nuo would be equivalent to κατανεύω, “to
assent to,” or, isthis is required, “to affirm'’ on esth. This
interpretation of tetum is of oeurse conjectured enly; and ins

Ol the next words we eannot make mueh. Touted praeentid=

Osean word, and firmato appears by the context to be a feminine
