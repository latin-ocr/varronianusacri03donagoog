bn'ngs us back to the root κε (above, p. 149); tor-om contains
the samo root as τορ-ός, ταρβεῖν, rodphe, hux, trucida tru-
eco-lentus, and we must sseign d-trooe to the same class, the initial
being either one of those prefixes, which we lind in ἅ-υήρ,
ὦπήρ, dcc, or e temnant ad, ss in muco, ddepr, ci-pmb, &c.;
and eq-oru compared with the Senscrit aevo refers us to the
root opu, ‘⁴ swift,’' Greek ὠκύς, Latin coer. All the words in
-vce, which have been mentioned, join this terminetion immedi-
ately to the root3 but in some few, to which incidental allusion
has been mede above (pp. 174, 233), the v immediately follows
an r,· thus from the roots ae and cat, both signifying “ shmp‚’'
we heve the derivativos acer-oue, ont-er-oo denoting s pointed
pyramidel heap, or s crowd following its leaders. similarly, we
have Miner-vo, from the root min, “to thinlr‚” end inthe
Arvalisn chent we lind lucr-offen] for luem. In these instances
we moy suppose that the affix -υ- is attached to a lengthened
crude form, just es hones-tce, onus-tos‚'tempeo-too‚ venue-tce, iu·
volve something more than the merc root ol the word, and there
need be no doubt thet the r in the cases just cited is merely the
usual substitute for en originale. The termination oue is also
appended to certain adjectives derived from and expressing the
verhsl abstractiom thus we have coti-one from the supine oc-
tnm (aetolos), by the side, oi ao-tio, noti-oue from cotum (no-
telos), bytho side of nor-tio, &o.; und weknow that the verb
forms in ee, -tum are the semein effect with the abstract nouus
in -eis- -m, -τύςτ--τέῐος, &e (Nero Orat. ἓξ 254, 410 (3)).

§ 6. (c) Formo with tlte clod Pronmninal Element only.

’ The most common forms, under which the third clement
sppeors as eu affix, are t- ond n-. The former must be osre-
sully distinguished from the participisl ending in dos, ond
those nouus in -tus, -wo, which, cs has just been mentioned·
belong to a formation connected with the second pronominsl
clement: tho latter must be identified with the endings in l
ond r including the diminutivcs in -ἶιω, -leuo (Now Orat. ξ 266).
For the'originul identity between tend n it may be sufficient

to refer to such forms cs reple-tue compared with ple-nus, cos- ⁸

oo compared with cincre, duo. The simple use of the third
clement, under the forms t or n occasionally softened into s=r,
