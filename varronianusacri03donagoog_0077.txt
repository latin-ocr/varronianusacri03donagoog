Eaetern Germany on their more direct rontc¹. 'Phe Geta, on
the other hand, wherever they were pure from any Sclevonic
admistura, stand es Low-Germana in direct oppositicn to the
Sclaroniane. As Masso· aare or Moeac- Gotlrs thcy were mixed
up with Mysiana, who were Pelasgo-Sclaveniane5 and there was
thesemo mingliug cf the Sclavoniau end Low-German clemente
in the Lithuanians or Somo- θείω. As Daci or Dones the pure
Low-Germana stand opposed and related', both in thc north and
south, to the Geta, whether called by this namo, or designated
aa Gotho, Gaddae, latas, and Vites: and there is every reason
to believe that the latter in this opposition represent some ad·
mixture of the Sclavenio and pure Gothic clemente anslcgous
to that which is presented by the Lithusniane cr Samo-Geta.
In the Greek oomedies Daoaa=Doocua‚ and Geta, standon a
parallel footing aa the names of eleves ; but the corutum from
which these slaves cerne were distinguished es Dacia and Moesia,
and the latter was, at least to a considerable extent, Sclavenic.
In the north, according to the legend⁸‚ the Doni or Dacini‘ were
settled in the islanda aa opposed to Jutlond, or, as it is called,
Viaoe-tste,· and in the peninsula itcelf the shatificstion of
Sclavonians in Schleawig Angles or pure Low-Germane in
Jntland, aud Higb-Germane in Holstein, is still very distinct.
In the immense arca to which the encients gave the name of
Scythia, we murt distinguish between the samam, or daroc-
motoe, who were mainly or to a large extent Sclavenian‚ the
Scytha or Aac-Gotho, who were mainly or to a large extent

Low-German, the &aa or ewa, who were purely Low-(ier-
man, and therefore identicsl ultimately with the Daci or Danes,
and the S-colctoe or Aac-Galata, also called Cimmerii, who were
mainly Celtic. And besides all these, we must allow a eub-
atratum or iringo ol Mongols ortamno-scythiano. N evertheless‚
