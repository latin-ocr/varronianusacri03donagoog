would be paying too great a oompliment to the etymological
knowledge of the Romans to suppose that they dreamt os an
affinity between the preposition mom, and the root of enro5

and even if this had been so, the repetition of the same elementa l

under different forms would have been in accordanoe with the
oldest examples of pronominal agglutination. The perfect ot‘

when the prepositional prefix eoalesoes with the first syllable of

It has been aheady mentioned that the vowel-verbs in -ἰ differ
from the semi-consonantal forms, which they so nearly resemble,
both in the origin and in the extent of the pronominal adjunct
by which they are qualified. For while the vowel ἰ· verb in-
volves not only a crude form in -ἰ, hut a repetition of the same
pronominal clement, the semi-consonantal i· verb uses this adjnnct
merely to strengthen the present tense and its immediate deriva-
tives‚ and loses all traces of it in those formatioris in which a
contraction is most conspicuous, namely, in the second person
singular of A. 1., and in the present infinitive. Thus, while we
have, from the crude form of oea-ti-s, vesti-oeoesti-yo, vest-a
:ocati-ab, and marmorati-pere, the mere root fne- gives ns
fac-ab=fac-yo, fac-la and faeere. As capri) has a perfect
cupisti and derivatives like cupido, we may perhaps be inclined
to consider cupere as a degenerata form, and to refer this verb
to the vowel-conjugation3 and this opinion might be confirmed by
its relation to capio. · For, according to a principle pointed ont
elsewhere (Nero Orat. ᾗ 53), capio and cupio are related hythe
