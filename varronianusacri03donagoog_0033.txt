ξ 4. Alba aad Lavinium.

The district oi' Latium, when history first speaks of it, was
thus occupied by two races3 one a mixed people of Oscen con·
querors living in the midst nithe Pelasgians whom they had
subdued, the ethera Pelasgian nation not yet conquered by the

invaders. These two natione formed nt first two distinct eon- Ι

federncies: of the former* Alia was the head, while the place of
congress for the latter was Lavinium. At the letter place, the
Penates, or old Pelasgian Oabeirr', were worshipped3 anderen
after the Pelasgian league was broken up by the power oi' Albe,
end when Alba became the capital of the united nation of the
Latins and sent a colony to Lavinium, the religious sanctity
of the place was still maintained, the Penates were still wor-

shipped there, and deputies still met in the temple of Venus. .

The influence of Alba was, however, so great, that even after its
sall, when the Pelasgian Latius pertially recovered their inde·
pendence, there remaineda large admixture of foreign clemente
in the whole population of Latium, and that which was purely
Pelasgian in their character and institutione became gradually
less end less perceptible, till nothing remained en the south of
the 'liber which could claim exemption from the predominating
influence of the Oscens.
, That the neme Lavinium is only a dialectical variety of
laeticiam has long been admitted. The original form of the
name Latinus, which esterwards fumisheda denomination for
the language of the civilised world, must have been hulvinum
and while the Pelasgian Latine preserved the lahial only, the
mixed people retained only the dentnl¹. We shall see in the
