degrees, with Pelasgians from the north-east. The main body
of these Pelasgians assumed a distinct nationah'ty in Etruria,
aud established a permanent empire there, which the Umbriam
could never throw off. Another great horda of Pelasgicos was
settled in Latium, where they were afterwards particlly con·
quered by the Osccns; and a mixed populationes Pelasgians
and Oscans extended to the very south of Italy. The Sabina,
however, who were members of the Umbrian family, returned
from the hills, to which the Pelasgians had driven them, and

with abranch of the Iatins settled on the Tibcr constituted
the first beginnings of that Roman people which, standing in

the midst of these Pelasgian and Osean raoes, eventually became
a point of centralisation for them all. Not to speak ol any

Celtic substratum, which we have many reasons for assuming, :
or of the scanty fragments of the Messapion or Iapygiae dialectis, ’

which probably preserved the Lithuanian elementa in their least
moditied form, we may feel assured that up to the commence-
ment of history the population of ancient Italy consisted entirely
of this admhtura or juxtaposition of Umbro-Ossan and Tyr-
rheno-Pelasgian tribes. But about the time when the ancient
annalista begin to speak definitely, the south of the peninsula
becanm stndded with Greek colonies, and the north was con-
quered bya Ratian tribe, the Rasena or Etruscsns properly so

called3 and while the Greeks never spread themselves in the ³

northern provinces, the surging tide of the Etruscan invasion
was beaten back from the walls of Rome; and the Gauls, who

south of the Tiber, were obliged to content themselves with the
still remoter districts beyond the Rubicon.
