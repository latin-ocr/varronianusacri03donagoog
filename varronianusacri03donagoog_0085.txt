authority for the present purpose is the inscription quoted by
Zenss (p 289), from Gradr'i Inscr. Antiquae, p. 56. 2, which
should be read: eEAI . ΣΕΛΗΝΗΙ . ΟΙΤΟΣΚΤΡΑΙ . ΚΑΙ .
ΑΠΟΛΛΩΝΙ . ΟΙΤΟΣΚΤΡΩΙ . ΜΙΘΡΑΙ . Μ . ΟΤΛΠΙΟΣ .
ΠΛΟΚΑΜΟΣ . ΝΕΩΚΟΡΟΣ . ΑΝΕΘ. This shows that the
epithet ol the “sun'' quoted aa Scythiau by Herodotus (with
the mere change of σκ for σ to represent the sonnd alr: see
Maelii le-Sophcr, p. 8) is applicable to the moon as well as to
the sun, and that Apollo· Oitoouraa was also Mithrae. Now we
know that Ἄρτεμις was specially worshipped hy the Persians3
for Plutarch says (Vir. Loculi. c. uh: Περσέα Ἄρτεμις ἣν
μάλιστα θεῶν οἱ πέραν Εὐφράτου βάρβαροι τιμῶσι, and her
Persian name Ζαρῆτις (Hesych.) was probably connected with
Har-pm but if she was, as this investigation has shown, also
identical with the heavenly Venus or Mithra, we find her Greek
name in Ἀρτίμπασα, the Scythiae Venus: for, as we shall
see, 'Apuripis best explained ont of the Scythian glossas,
aa “the virgin oi the sca‚” aud πάσα signifies “the queen.'’
The noun was probably Persian eleo, lor Artior-peso occurs
on two inscriptions found near Tusculum and probably oi
Persian origin (Zanes, p. 290). Itis by no means clear what
were the attributes ot* the celestia] Venus ni the Scythians3 but
her namo thus explained corresponds exectly to the functione
of Europa, the broadlaccd moon, and to those of the Ἄρτεμις
Ταυροπόλη.

The Scythian name for Neptune may be explained with
almost demonstreble certainty. The general observatione on the
Scythiau langnage have shown that they preferred the tenuis to
the aspirate. The word Θαμιμασάδας must therefore have been
pronounced Tomi-macndos. Now, if we compare this word
with the Scythiae proper name Οοέα-ηιωαᾱαε (Herod. 1v. 80),
we shall see that maadaa must be the termination. In the
Zend, or old Medion langnage, Mondou (connected with mae,
“great”), signifies “a god,’' or “object of worship.'’ So Or-
nrnsol ie called Atura-maedan, and a worshipper is termed
Mozduyacua. Accordingly, Tamimuoodas must mean “a god,
or object of worship, with regnrd to Tami.” When, therefore,
we leam from Pliny, that Tcnrornadu is equivalent to mater
nurci, we cannot doubt that Teme, or Tomi, means “the sea‚”
