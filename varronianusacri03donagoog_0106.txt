§22 Taena paniarum of rte ambertensem.

In comparing the old Etruscam witha branch of the Teu·
tonic racc, the first step will naturally be to ask whether the
distinctiva habits and peculiarities of the Resenic invaders of
northern Italy corresponded with those of the Scandinavians in
question. If we take even what we know of the physical cha-

racteristica oi the Etruscam, we shall see that wo have a rece
more like the Gothic tribes of the north thau the Italians, with

whom they stand in immediate contact. “The Etruscans,” ἵ

says Mommsen¹, “present the most striking 'contrmts to the 2
Latin and Sabellian Italians, as well as to the Greeks. Their ἕ

very bodily structure would be sufficient to distinguish them p
from the other two nations. Instead oi the symmetrical slender·

ness of the Greeks and Italians, the· sculpturas of the Etruscam η
show us short, sturdy figures, with large heads and thick arms. Ἴ

Their manners and customs, so far as we are acquainted with

thern, as clearly prove them to be a people originally quite ’

distinct from the GraecoItalian races.” In the days oi Ca·
tullus ⁸, and even of Virgil⁸, the obesity oi the Tuscans was
their distinctiva peculiarity. And this, as iswell known, to-
gether with the broad, short figure so remarkable in the (lbrscan
monuments, is equally observable in the legendsry Scandina·
viana and their medem representatives. A nation, which sings
the praises oi little but doughty champions, who conquered
gigantic opponente, is generally found tc combine strength and
pugnacity with a stature conspicuously shorter than that of the
conterminous tribes. The Ros, Roseae, or “Runncrs,” were,

we may depend upon it, araca of sturdy, active, nimblc little ἵ

men, like their representative the giant-killer of the nurscry
talea, with his seven-leagued boote end his swerd ol shurpncss.
