makes the perfect, and that the insertion of ι- indicates the
conjunctivam optative mood. Moreover, we have in the Greek
verb an augment, or syllable prefixed for the purpose of marking
past time as such, and traces at least of the systematis employ-
mcnt of reduplication to designate the continuance of an action.
Aa the ancient cpia poetry of the Greeks neglecta the augment,
we may understand how it fell into &suetudo among tha Romans.
The reduplication too, though common to all the old Italian lan-

' gnages, is ol only partial application in tho existing forms of
the Latin verb. With regard to the valna ol the tenses in σ-
and a· the same holds to a certain extant in Latin als03 but
while the principle is here susceptible of a double application‚ it
is, on the other hand, interrupted hythe operation of a system
of composite tenses which is peculiar to the Latin language, and
still more ao by the regular use of the affin-s to express derived
or indefinite tanam.

which enters so largely into all temporal relations.

contains the root ea, Sanscr. aa, Greek εσ-, Lith. ea-,· the other, '
the root fia«, Sanscr. bid, (ir. pu, Lith. baa.

The inflexione of ea· are aa follows:
