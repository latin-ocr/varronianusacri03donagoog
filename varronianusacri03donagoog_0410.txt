The true explanation is suggested by deni-qne end its hy·forrns
dnn-que (in the Selien hymn, above, p. 236), done-c, end doni-
cnml. Greek particles expressing time end either in ωηεν,

es mirica, πηνί-κα, mvl-ra, rivi-xe, or in re, as ’ό-τε, rii-re, wd-rc,
’ eri-re, ἑκάστο-τε, dre. It is cleer thet these endings ere nlti-
metely identice13 but it may be concluded‚ that, while the letter
gives rather a degree of precision to the term, the former,
which more immediately corresponds to the well-known particle
of the epodosis‚ comes neerer in meaning tc the Latin cunque =
-co-re, end our -coeoen The Latin -que corresponds in nome
ceses to -xa or ἄν, in others to -τε, Thus, while -cnn-qege is
’ erc-re, there cen be no doubt es to the equivalenoe oi edique end
ὅπου ἄν, of mni-m end deni-que (Now Orat. ξ 196). The pub-
etitution of the tenuis for the medial in the Greek forms is
not universal, ior we here bre δή by the side of qnando, end
when thie appetent difference is removed, we have no difficulty
in seeing the exact correspondence between τῆμος, es opposed
to ἦμος, and dimum for which, according to Festus (p. 70,
Mllller), Livius Andronicus wrote deman. As the element dem
is placed indifferently before or efter the particle which it qne·
lifies (cf. &neore with ten-dem, pri-dem), we shall understand
the correspondence between quotam, berre δή, end the synony-
