told thot there exists α’ lorge collectiones Etruscan 'inscriptions
which cannot be satisfactorily explained One conse oi the un-
profitnbleness of Tusccn inscriptions is to be, attributed to the
fect, that these inscriptions, being mostly of a sepulchral-or dedi-
cetoriol character, ore generally mede np of proper names and
conventionnl expressions Consequently they contribule very
little to our knowledge of the Tuscen syntex, nnd ,furnish us
with very few forms of inflexion. So far ss I heve heard, wc
heve no historicnl'or legal inscriptions. These which I have

inspected for myself ers only monumentel epitaphs end the dedi·

cntions of offerings.

· Tbese observationis might be justified by en examinetion of
cll the inscriptions which have been hitherto published. It will
be sufficient, however, in this plnoe to show how much or how
little cen bodone by en enalysis of the great inscription which

was discovered in the neighbourhood of Perngis in the year
1822. This inscriptionis engrsved on two sides of a block oi
stone, end consists of fortydive lines in the whole3 being by ier
the most copious of nll the extant monuments of the Tuscnn lnn-
gusge. 'l'he writing is singulerly legible, end the¹ letters were
coloured with red pnint.
