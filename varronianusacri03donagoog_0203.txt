The form Nephtmaas (ap. Grut. p. 460) ie simply the participle
νιπτόμενος. If the word Natisone,- which ie found on aTuecau

mirror over a figure maniseetly intended for Neptune (Berlin.
Jahrb. for August 1841, p. 221), is to be considered as the

2 genuine form of the eea-god’s name, there will of course be uo

difficulty in referring it to the-same root (see below, ᾗ ).

The Tusean Pluto, ee ie well known, was called Monate, and
trem him the city Mantua derived ite name. The etymology ol
thie word is somewhat confused by its contem with the terma
moues cadmaeis. That the letter are connected with the old
word maous=donrss can hardly be doubted²3 and the depre-
catory euphemism oi such a designation is quite in accordance
with the ancient mode of addressing these mysterious func·
tionaries of the lower world. But thenit is difficult to explain
Mantus aa a derivative from this manua. Now, as he is repre·
sented in all the Tuscau monuments as e huge wide-mouthed ’
monster with a persono pollentia ihtes, it seems better to
understand his name aa eignifying “the devourer;” iu which
sense he may be compared with the yawniug end roaring Olta-
ron². This, at any rate, was the idea eonveyed by the manducas,

²Varre seems to connect the word Munius with οιοοιο, “morning'’
(1,. L. ru tto). ·

¹ See Now Oret. d 283. Another personage of the same lrind is lippias,
“ the caller.” Aa Charon is attended by the three-heeded Κέρβερος, so
the three-bodied Geryon hes a two-headed dog, ὀρθρος, who is brother
to Cerberus (Hesiod. Theop. 308, sqq.); thetis “the morning” (ὄρθρος)
is brother to the ‘⁴ darkness'’ (κίρβεροοτ ride Sahal. Od. h, 14, end Poreon
ad 1.,· Kipyupos· ἅχλῦο, Hesyeh.; and Lobeok, Paralipom. p. 32). By
a similar identity, Geryon liues in the distant west, in Erythia, the land
ot darkness, just aa Charon is placed in Hedes3 aud theaeteto beings,
with their respective dege, both ligure iu the mythology of Hercules, who
appears as the enemy oi Pluto, andei his type, Eurystheus. It may be
remarked, too, that Pluto is described as an owner of doclra aud herds,
which isthe chief feature in the representatione of Geryon. Mr. Keight-
ley remarks in the additions to hie ΜγιΙίοὶορμ, p. 359: “ Theugh πο could
not perhaps satisfactorily prore it, we hare s strong notieu that Geryo-
neus (from γηρῦο) is only another form ot Hades. They both, rre may

· observa, had herda of oren, and the two-heeded dog of the former

answers to the three-headed dog ot the letter. Admetus, apparently
another form ot Hades (p. lta), tras also famous for his herda. We lind
