elegant stiffness of copied heroic¹ or lyric poetry. Consequeutly,
though the comedians borrowcd their matres from the Greeks,
they were content to pronounce the words as they were uttered
by the common people3 end as the busy talkers of the forum
were wont to clip and contract their words, so the syllables
usually omitted iu speaking were not taken into account ou the
comio stage. When, therefore, we can recognize the law of the
verse in a Latin comedy, but find that the syllables, as they
stand written in many of the lines, are more numerous than
is necessary for the feet of the verse according ιο the usual laws
of quantity, we may safely conclude that the superfluous sylla-
bles wcre omitted in the pronunciation of the actor3 and if by
him, ὰ fortiori, that they were habitually slurred over by the
majority of his audienoe. This opinion will be confirmed, if we
discover, on further inquiry, that the syllables so dispensed with
are not found in the corresponding forms exhibited by the
modern idioma which derive their origin from the language of
ancient Rome.

The following instances, few out of many, may be sufficient
to establish thiar. Let us first take some of the short impera·
tives, which are, bytho nature of the case, especially liable to
hurried pronunciation. As our look! has degenerated into lof,
