destroy the Roman texture of the languag'e which was· spoken
by the inhabitants of Gaul. At first both the conquerors and the
conqueret retained their own idioms3 and the linqua Fmambco,
or Franeieo, oi the German invaders, flomished by tho side ol
the linqua Gallica, or Galltbana, of the conquered provinciola.
In time, however, as there was much more literary culture
among the latter, and as the priests and scholam of the age wera
all fumished by the district in which the Franks had settled,
the standard of diction would be sought in the language of the
more educated class, and the Roman language, more or less cor·
rupted, would gradually become the medinm of communication
between the oonquemrs and the conquerod. ’

Aa might have been expected, this gradual adoption of the
Roman langtmge by the Teutonic invaders gave rise to a number
of dialecto. Of these the most reline'd and polished was that
which was spoken by the inhabitants ol the south-castam dis-
trict of France. Many causes conspired to give this idiom an
earlier development. The south-castam provinciale were more
completely Romaniaed in tha first instauoe¹3 they were leae aub-

Δ jected to foreign invasion than the other inhabitants of France3

the Burgundians and Visigoths‚ who settled among them, ware
mora adopted for social lile than their German brethren, and more
readily assimilated their language and cuatoma to those ol their
subjecta; and when at length Provence became a part ol' the
Frankish dominions, the conquerors were no longer unruly
Gamau barbaricus, but the oivilized and Romaniaed subjecte of
a regular monarchy. .The happy elimate oi Provenca‚ aud tha
wealth and commarca of the pacple‚ contributed to foster and en-
courage those arts which can only flourish in a genial soil 3 and
we' are not to wonder if the pmvincials outstript the northern
Gaulo in intellectual tastes as wellias in physioal ccmforts.
