’ ’ (Μαελπῖ lez-Sopho, p. 15). The Latin language, lilre the

Hebrew, contente itself with one pronominal clement, nemely, π’,

· signifying “distance” end “separation” for both negetion and

prohibition, but distinguishes these in form by adopting a eom·
pound or lengthened word for the categorica] negative, while the
lrypothetical word appears without eny such strengthening ι
addition. Thus, while the common expression for the cate-
gorical negative is non for πεππ, or nonu, which is obviously
ne oenum or ne ararcmqwith the ecthlipsis of the final m, we lind

merely ne in the prohibitive sense, in ordinary Latin. There are =

traces in single words and in the older authors ol a strengthening
affix c in this latter use (above, p. 118), corresponding to the
affix which appears in ori-n or οῠ-χί. We must distinguish this
uffix from the conjunctior] que, which appears in the disjunction
are-que (Mllller, Suppl. Αππ. od Fest. p. 387). If, then, we
'compare ori-e = ἇ-να-Ἑα-ιε with ne-e, we shall see that they differ
only in the inserted clement fo, and there is no reason to suppose
that the categorical πόπ differs from the hypothetical ae, other·
wise then by the strengthening word unam, which is also in·
volved in cottonianae-tas. On the other hand, we see from
the categorical use of n‘anqaom, n'aaquam, eve-quedem and ne-
que, that the negative ne may always bc used in a denia] of facts, -
if it is only sufficiently strengthened. The identity of dvo-[Falx
end nec is further shown by the use of the negative es a prefix
in Latin. Of this we have three forms3 the simple ne or ni as
in nefas, are-acio, ni-lril, rvi-si, διας the same with θεῖα pre-
fixed, as in ine'quue, iar-numerus, immensus, i-qnocreo, ὅπη
with eaffixed, as in neeqvinuo, nep-otium, neq-layo or nee-lr'po.
As it is quite clear that in these instanoes the clement π is thet
which gives the negative force, and as' this clement is common to
n’on and ae, it follows that the &mans did not distinguish
between the form of the prohibition and categorioal negation
otherwise than by strengthening the latter. And this extenuation
of the negative emphasis in subordinate expressions is also shown
bytho fact, thatin conditional and final sentences, the mere dimi-
