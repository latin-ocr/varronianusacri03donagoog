It will be shown that the national iutegrity of the Umbrians
was impaircd by their successive contacta with the Tyrrheno·
Pelasgians, and the Etruscans properly so called3 aud it will be
convenient to consider, aa separate questions, these qualifying
elementa iu the population of ancient Umbria.

Without stoppiug to inquire at present who the Pelasgians
were out of Italy, let us take them up where they first make
their appearance at the mouth of the Po. We find that their
area commences with this disnict, and that, having crossed the
Apennines, they wrested from the Umbrians the great city

Το these Pelasgiana were due the most important elementa

aud Latium the Pelasgian nationality was never extinguished:
even among the Latine it survired the sevcrest shoclrs of Oscan
