But whenever it was thought advisable, on great emergencies, to
revert to the authority of a single chief, we find that this Dis-
tator, as he was called, appeared as a Iana‘stcr Populi, 'or head
of the old patrician tribes, and that he was invariably associated
with a Magister Equdum, or head of the plebeiam knights, whom
the elder Tarquin admitted to the full franchise, and so made his
senate to consist of Patres, or original deputies, and Corucraptr',
ur additional counsellors. The Duumoirr' Perduells'ouis and
'other ancient dualisms pointed out by Niebuhr are additional
indicatione of a two-feld division of the Roman people long before
the growth of the later pkhs. Now if the second order corre·
sponded to the Luceres, as opposed to the combined populus of
&mnes and litias, we can easily see that the Tarquinian
influenoe, aa exercised by Caeles Vivenna and Mastama, was
favoursble not only to the Celeres or richer class among the
Duceres, hut also to the Proletarians, and generally to the whole
population3 whereas the second Tarquinius is indicated by his
whole history as having endeavoured to reduce and degrada
the inferior order of his subjecta until some final outrage roused
the whole city to vengeance‚ the Luceres however taking the
lead under the guidance of their legitimate leader the Tribunus
Celerem. The result of this revolution was to reduce the
mulus, or two elder tribes, to a footing of tolerable equality
with the laeseras· and the lays or legenda represent the latter
as having purchased their position by a pre-eminence of suffer·
ings and of services, both in the expulsion of the Tarquinian
dynasty and in the subsequent resistance to the foreign domina-
tion of the Clusium.

A great deal of new light may be derived from a careful
examination of the proper names Horatius aud Lucretius, the
former representing the inferior position of the populace, the
latter the local designation of the Luceres. The word Hor-etiae
'is derived from the old Latin word hir, “ a hand,'’ and is there-
fore a longer form of Hir-tries, just es Οκνίαείω is of Our-ta‘ua
