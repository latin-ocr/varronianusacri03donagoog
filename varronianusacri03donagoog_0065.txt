carious to inquiro how the traditionary quarrels between the
families of Dardanus and Tantalus contributed to produce the im·
portant Lydian migration into Greece; but such an investigation
scarcely belongs to our subject. There seems to be good reason
for believing that the Pelasgiaos required their distmctire cha-
racter, that of agriculturists and architecte, in the fertile plains oi
Asia Minor, and under that climate which was afterwards so pror
lilio in worlrs of art and genius. 'lhose only of the Pelasgians
*who were connected with the commercial activity oi the Medi-

terranean, namely the Tyrrheniam, were celebrated as artisens
and teser-builders.

'l'he immediate derivation of eren the later Greek architectura
from Asia Minor may be proved by some combinatione which
throw an important light not only on the history of ancient art,
bnt on the ethnical affinitics of the old inhabitants of southern
and motem Europe. It is well known that the Greeks or Hel-
lenos descended from the north of Thessaly aird conquered or
incorporated themselves with the Pelasgo-Achaeans‚ whom they
found in the south of Grecos. Now these Pelasgam, especially
those who called themselves &aarum or “·tower·builders,'-’
hare lest behind them numerous remains of their architecture,
which are distinguished by immense blocks of solid stone built
into rude messes of walls, towers‚ and measuries, and are com-
monly called chlopeaa. It was of course this architectum which
the Hellenes found in southern Graece, and as they were a
warrior-tribe and less cultivated in every respect then their
vessels, they must hare adopted the same style of building.
What origin then must we sech for the characteristic architecture
oi the DoroIonians-*that which we commonly call Grecian
architectum? The cluo to the whole is firmished by that sin-
gular monument, the gare of the lions of Mycena, probably the
oldest memoriales the primitive Achaeans. We have here, at
the cumanos of a Cyclopean tressera-house, two lions trampling
on an inserted column oi Dorian architectura With regard to
the lions I feel no hesitation in rejecting Oreuzer's suppositione
