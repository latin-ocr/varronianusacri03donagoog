gladiatorial prey. But Saturam is the Phoeniciau Moloeh, iu
whose worship the sacrifice of human victims took its rise¹.
Accordingly the practice os offering up human victims must
have boen derived by the ancient Greeks and Italians, through
the Pelasgian ingredient in their composition, from the Phoeni·
cian and other Syriau tribes, who trafficked with the coasts of
the Mediterranean. While, however, these natione and their
pure descendants, the Carthaginiaus, retained this inhuman
practice iu its original and unmitigated form, the Greeks soon
shock off this barbarous worship, aud found various substitutes,
of which the interruptcd sacrifice of Iphigenia is s mythical
representatiou¹. The Roseus on the other hand, with rude war·
like instincta, aud with the practice ol the Ham-punga already
established among them, were naturally led to pit the captives
destined for sacrifice to fight against one another3 and, instead
of slaying them in oold blood, to make them become both sacn-
ficcrs aud victims in the firneral solemnity. Under peculiar cir·
cumstauces the old eastern ferocity was retained, as when the
Tarquiniana, iu the year auo. 397, sacrificed in cold blood
307 Roman prisoners os war to the Suu-God or God ol the year,
aa the number oi thevictims seems to show'. At private fune· ,
rals, however, the fight of gladiatore invariably took tbe place of
the human sacrifice. Servius⁴ attributes the origin ol this sub·
stiurtiou to the funeral of J unius Brutus; but he seems to cou-
fuse between the origin of the practice, and the first beginning of
a public exhibition or manua oi gladiators‚ in which the amuse-
meut oi the people was combined with the honours duc to the
dead. This appearance of the Etim-ponpa, instead of the cold· ,
blooded slaughter iu which the Pelasgo-Phoenician rites iu·
dulged, seems to me a remarkable indication of the connexion
of the Bosana with a branch of the Teutonic family, which,
whether in sport or eamest, delighted in every form of martial

spectacles, aud whose descendants in another part oi Europe in·
