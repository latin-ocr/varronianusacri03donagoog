cunque by writing the former with o and the latter with d, and
they would also distinguish queilqu0=et quid from quicque:
“every thing‚'‘ and would also write quicquam (Lachmann,
ad Lucre. v. 264, p. 286). Thus they would write quicquat
in Ter. Adelpt.1v.2,51: atquc uuum quioquid, puodqers'dem
erit tentatam carpam ; in Lucret. v. 304: et primum qrcrbqwid
flomercram perdere semper (cf. v. 291: et primum piretum ful—

opertam eat .· but qualiquali in such passages as Virgil, AEner'd. 11.

noun is manifestly relative. The first syllables ol ali-preb have
been discussed above, and there is no difficulty in understanding
the compound es significent of separative uncertainty-“ that
other some one.” Thst quob-piam and quebqaom very nearly
correspond in meaning is clear from such passages as the fol-

the Roman grammarians3 for Festus says(p. 254): quaepiam

considers perir-pabor ae identical in meaning with aliquia But

this is not the csse3 lor we may always use the English “ any’' l

in translating quei-pabor, and must always introduce the English
“ some” in rendering ali-quob, ali-preat, ali-qmado, duc. 'Phe idio-
matic difference between quaepiam and qucquam consiste in this,
