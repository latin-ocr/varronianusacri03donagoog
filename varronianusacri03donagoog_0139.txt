&cam and tutes are two adverbs. The former signifies
“ with reverence,” and contains the rcot aeo- (aeaeae) or σεβ-
(σέβων. The latter is derived from cac-eo, watra, with the
affix ·f= φι, and means “ caufionsly.”

The words ar’epea araca or ar'iper arati, which conclude
almost every prescripticn in the first Table, are not very easy.
That Grotefend’s translation pro ardores. athre aroiqa is in·
admissible, every scnnd philolcger must at once concede. The
following suggests itaelf as the most probable solution. It
appears that the Umbrica participle generally ended in -cs, -ea,
or -eais, like the old Greek participle of verbs in -μι, Thus we
have maes, aaa, and taiea, for taceae. Vestris, too, is obviously
a participle (vl. a, 22). As, then, we coustantly find the im·
peratire acea for adveiito, we may surmise thet arces, arvae,
is the participle for ciceiam aad ar'epaa aia'prer, cn the same
principle, will be atam so that the phrase will signify adires
adveheret s. por-riperta i. e. ‘⁶ offering up the soit iat.'’

Accordingly, the translation of the whole passage should run
thus: Ante portam traheam Jcci Grabaei> tres doces facito,
arcini ostendito, fatad ferr'rutt facito, cei virro cel pace, pro
monte Fato, pro eim'tate Iqucind, facita severa, caute precator,
adires adoriens, ie. “Before the gate, by which the trebia
enter, sacrifice three oxen to Jupiter Grabovins, offer up the hard
fat, sacrifice with unsalted meal, either with wine or bread, for

the Fisian mount, for the city of Iguvium, sacrifice reverently, .

pray cautiously, holding forth the soit fat of the victims.''
Huschke wauslates the passage as follows: Pro martir (verca
from warjaa=dffeoderd Trebulanis Joci Gradovab tres bocca
facita, ma amaia, pectorapectora, Gr. βαθύς, Terentiae βατός)
cmfacdc, cel cino cel malso (paci, Gr. πῖνον), pro racnte Frhr'r),
pro arbe Iprccirra facito, carmen (secum from seo :dr'ca carroco,
lca) caute prwator, immota (cirpea from ἆῤῥεπήςῐ) strepitibus
(arm from ἄραβος l)

¹ According to huiracht and Kirchhcff, (p. 418) aaron is the same
adjective ss that which turnishes the lnitial syllable to mantuanensis
from chronnam and is therefore to be compared with the Latin sollus
from calm, Gr. Mor, sanant tarta.
