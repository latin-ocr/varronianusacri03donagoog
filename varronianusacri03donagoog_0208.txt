Mr. Ellis compares the Bato-Romansh hieracha, “huslr‚”
“burk”
Aquilam, “ a collector of springs for aqueducts.” Varro ap. Noae.
Marc. 2, 8: “ at hoc pacto, utilior te Tuscus aquilea?
Aeacos, “a hawlr.’‘ Hesych. Ἄρακος* ἱέραξ Τυῤῥηνοί. See
Haruspex. We may compare the O. N. eri, “ an eagle.”
Arianae, “ ape.'' Strabo, xl11. p. 626 D: recl rods πιθήκους φασὶ
παρὰ τοῖς Τυῤῥηνοῖς aalma καλεῖσθαι. Hesych: ἅριμος·
πίθηκος. There is no oewnnty about this word. Thereis
some confusion of ideas between the place called Arimi on
the coast of Cilicia, and the island Pithecusa on the coast ol
Campania. The commentators would connect it with tha

Hebrew Dl'ttJ (charam), Lavit. xxi. 18, which significa “ snub-

nosed,'’ aimar,· if this can he admitted, the only way ol .
explaining the Semitic etymology will be by reading παρὰ
τοῖς Τυρίοις in the passage of Strabo. Mr. Ellis compares
the Armen. apr, “homo‚” on the analogy of crouy-matanp,
which signifies man.

Aroe-verae. Fest. p. 18: “Araeoeroe averte ignem significat.
Tuscorum enim lingua arae averte, cerac ignem constat appel·

An inscription found at Cortona contains the following words:
Aroes caraea 81111ιηί tephrcl ape temon preest eata (Orelli,
no. 1394). Miiller considers this genuine (quem quominus
pcaaiaam haheamw nihil octct); Lepsios will not allow its
authenticity, but thinks it is made up of words horrowed

· from other sources. Be this as it may, the words arae verae
must be admitted aa genuine Etruscam and they are also
cited by Placidus (illesa. opud Maiora, p. 434). It seems
prohable that arse is merely the Latin arce with the usual
sostening of the guttura13 and verse contains the root of πῦρ,
pir, fena, ber, dcc. Pott (Et. Forach. 1. p. 101) seems to
prefer taking verse as the verb, Lat. veto, and orac as the
noun, comp. ardere. Taphrai must be compared with tepidas
and the other analogias pointed out above (Oh. 11. ᾖ 11); it
comes very near to the Oscan toforom (Tae. Apa. ll. 17, 20),
and to the form thiparoaoi in the Cerretri inscription (below,
ξ 5). From all these reasons we may conclude that it belongs
to the Pelasgian clement in the language. If the Cortona
