ᾗ 17. The Fetere ef the Infinitive Paetina.

„ One of the most remarkable peculiarities of the Latin verb
is the contrivance which is adopted to supply a firbrre tense to
the infinitive passive. That the verb ao, when used as au auxi·

liary, should contributa to the formation oi a periphrastic future, ·

is a phenomenon, which should not smpriae us 3. for. we find
analogous idioms in a number of languages; the Greek has ᾖα
λέγων, “I was about to say‚” the Frenoh hasje verb aeriter, “ Ι
arn about ιο arrive,” and we say, “I am going to write a letter,”
when we wish to intimate the intention of doing so. But the Latin
future infinitive passive is formed by the'passive infinitive of the
uenter verb a> affixed to the supine or active infinitive of the
verb which is ιο be expressed in the given tense. This idiomatie

usage is not so singular as it seems. It is the regular prac- .

tice in Latin to make the auxiliary rather than the dependent
infinitive liable to the modificatione of tense. Thus when we
say, “ he ought not to have done it,’' the Latin idiom required
noa operabat fecere, to which an English vulgariam suppliesa
sort of equivalent. The same principle is adopted to effect a
modification of voice, when convenience requires it. Thus as
alerici ia deponent and cannot be used passively, Sallust writes
(anertha, xxxl.): quidquid aine renquiae dodam alethei nequi-
tur, “whatever it is impossible to aveuge without shedding the

blood of citizens.'' Similerly in Cato, θήρ. 1.: qnod Termino
fenam fnit, id aequem acaaqarari, and in Senserit we have

(Nolae, xx. 5): ae abertate polege-td, i. e. efferre aequiter for ' '

afferri nequit (Now (bat. 5447). In the same way, then, we
write amatam iri, “ ιο he about to be loved ;'’ and the idiom is
the more intelligible‚ because we have the impersonal passive
itur, “it is gone‚'‘ i. e. “ people go.'' So that spero aem amatam
ἐπ’ eh omnibus, naturally means, “I hope that it is gone by sll
ιο love him,” i. e. “ that all are going to love him.’'
