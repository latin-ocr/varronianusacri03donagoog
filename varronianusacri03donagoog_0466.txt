positione, bnt with other verbel roots, signifying “doing’' or
‘⁴ camingss’ as opposed to eo, which denotes the passive result of
the action: thus we have per-do, or peream-do, oppoffl to per-ec,

corresponding Greek forms rre'pdc, tre, we may be led to oon-

clude that the Latin do furnishes the link of connexion between ,
dibeas, Sanscrit dodtfms' and τίθημι, Senserit ‹ladtomi; which ,

are therefore only different forms of the same root. The idea
of “giving’' is partly represented by thet of “parting’' or
“placing” for acceptanoe In regard to the offuing of prices,
or the placing of meat on the table, the ideas of placing and
giving run into one another, end it is well known that pono
and τίθημι are regularly used in this sense (see my note on
Pindar, 0. xl. 63, and the commentatore on Horace, 1. seor

t‚106; 11. 3, 23). But we may also represent the act of

giving with reference to the donor ss a liberal pouring forth of
that which he ha's, and this is the primery sense of pes-on,

prb-oo, “give'' χέΓ-ω, dre, as Grimm has shown in a special l
paper on the subject (Ass Alc. Ber-l. 1848: “ iiber schenken nnd 2
geben”). The other verb, which appears to belong to the -a ,

conjugarentur has a reduplicated perfect, is sto, which makes

A. III. steti. This verb does not give the same indicatione ss do ¹

of a mere srticulation·vowel; for even the componnds retain the

long ᾶ, which appears in nabot, &c But we have a by-form, l

ον’-σω, to which steti may be referred, just as cnr transitive '-
“stay,’‘ intransitive “stand’' ere represented by the German
present ooefse, perf. swod, both of which are intrapsitive. And
I am inclined to explain the long a in sto, as resulting from a
contractiori of stabo =rteyo, Germ. atekeu which is still found in
the Umbrian amico-:stato (above, p. 98). So thet sto can-

. nothe considered as a verb, of which the characteristic or for-

mative adjunct is -o, but, like do, oves its contractiori tc the con-
tect of the root-syllable with the termination. With these two

exceptione, all -o verbs form their perfect in -m'or-vs'. Althongh ,

the Greek vowel-verbs particularly affect the aorist in -σιι, and
indeed have no other, we find that no vowel-verb in Latin has
the const-perfect in -οί, unless it has dropt in this tense its
chsracteristic vowel-in other words, we have no Latin perfect
