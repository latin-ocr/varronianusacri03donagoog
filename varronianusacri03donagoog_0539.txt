concourse of consonante, to abridge their composite forms3 and
in the haste of polite conversation we may hear the most sesqui-
pedalian utterances at St Petersburg¹. Itis only the Latin
language and its daughters, in which we observo this systematis ,
shortening, first of spoken, and afterwards of written words, and
therefore we may both attribute it to the habits of the people,
and describe it as the characteristic feature of the Romam and
Romanos form of speech. '

There are two ways in which this tendency manifesta itself-
in the less ol the termination‚ and in the coalition of syllables in
the middle of the word.

When clipt or mutilated words are common in any langusge,
the cause is to be sought in the strength and prominenoe of the

’ single acoent¹, which is generally thrown forward as far as pos·

sible, and in the impatience with which practica] and busy men
hurry through that part of their work which consiste in talking.
The rules of the Latin metrical system might have prepared us
for something of the kind. It has been shown in a former chap-
ter (above‚ p. 264), that the triple recurrence of the ictus was
the essential feature of the Saturnian verse, the thesis being ob-
served or neglected at the pleasure of the composer. similarly,
¹ the accentuated syllable of a word, or that on which the em-
phasis of pronunciation was allowed to fall, was supposed to
represent the significance of the term, justas the weight ola
body is considered to be collected at its centre of gravity3 and
the other syllables were slurred over or cast aside as superfluous
and unnecessary incumbrances. As instauras of this, one might
adduce a number of syncopiaed forms of common words. Wc'
harenc foretque, amovere sor amomo, amare for amerii, crat
for aab, do sor domo, dein for deinde, you for gaudiia, nac for
aequa bonfortasse, ni for nasi, pc for parta, po for popam, sau

lor sicel, &o.; and, not to speak of the orbarpn, by whieha

11³.. g. the common Russiau for “present my compliments to your
facher” is narcidyatcl'atuuets mos poemenia amma bapinbkya i. c. testi

floamiaor meam mnarationem castro patri, where the conventional verbls ἱ ’

as long as sn Aristophanic compound.
