Niebuhr suggests (111. note 841) that the first line is au attempt
at au hexameter, and the last two an imitationes the shorter
verse ; and this remark shows the discernment which is always
so remarkable in that great scholar. The author of this traus-
lation, which was probably made soon after the original, could
not write iu hexameter verse, but he represented the hex-
ameter of the original by a lengthened serm of the Saturnius,
and indicated the two penthemimere os the pentameter by waiting
their meaning in two uuneated Saturninus, taking care to indi-
cate by the cumae that there was really a break in the
rhythmos the original pentameter, although it might be called
a single line according to the Greek system of matres.

To return, however, to the epitaphs of the Scipion. The
scansion of the lines, which I have adopted, is sufficientl'y iudi·
cated by the metrical marks placed over the words. Itis only
necessary to add a few explanatory observatione. With the ex·
ception ot' a. 2, 3, b. 3, and c. 7, every line begins withan ana·
crusis, or unaccentuated thesis3 and it seems to be a matter of
indiffereuce whether this is one long or two short syllables.
The vowel a is osten prononnced likey before a vowel, as in
Iaiepas(a.1,) Laoyom (b 3) )dyalab (c. 1), brevya (c. 2), inpe-
apum (c. 3), altyer (c. 4), primya (c. 6), sappo (ibid). And ιι
is prononuced like w inc. 2. The mles of synaloepha and
ecthlipsis are sometimes attended to (as m a. 6), and sometimes
neglected (as' m b. 5, c. 4). The quantity of silbae and otro' ru
b. 2, may be justified ou general principles 3 lorfas'ase is properly
firmine, and siro iswritteu eea'ro in Umbrian. But there is no
consistency in the syllabic measurement of the words in these
rude lines. Facile, in c. 5, makes a thesis in consequence oi
that short pronunciation which is indicated by the old form
facul (Fest. p. 87, Mttller). As all the other verbs iu epitaph a.
are in the perfect tense, it seems tbat eebipit and abdoacit in the
last line, must be perfect also. Iadoacs’mea is perhaps aperfect
in the Tiburtius inscription (l. 10): “ postquam senatus audivit,
tanto magis-indominatas ;'' aud ascbipit was probably pro·
nonuoed calm. The beginning of b. seems to have been the
conventional phraseology in these monumental nenias. The
