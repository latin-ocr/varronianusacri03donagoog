Resides these, agreat number of words and forms of words in the
Sabine langnage are explicable most readily from a comparison
with the Lithuanian3 and the general impression which these
arguments leave upon our mind is, that the Latius and Sabines
were of the same race as the Lithuanians or old Prnssians. A
special argumentis fumished by the scanty remnants of the Mes-
sapian or lapygian language, which was spoken in the south ·
enatem comer 01 Italy. For this fragmentary language, lyr'ng
beyond the reach 01 any influences except that oi the Greek
coloniats, into whose idicm it was rapidly absorbed, may be
regarded as a pure remnant of the old Italian. Now it is re·
markable that the few Messapian words, which have come down
1ο us with an explanation of their meaning, admit 01 more direct
comparison with the Lithnanian, aa a German-sclavonia lan-
gnage, than with any other. . Thus we are 1011111101βρένδοςοτ
