Tutor-aea, Paeon-tes, Fruere-tw, Fece-ee, Nur-tea, (Gorssen,
Zcfuchr. f. Veryl. Sprf. 1852, pp. 6, 13). Some suppose that
. the English Lord is related to the same root3 see, however,
Nero Orat. §3382 and as the Lares were connected with the
Cabiriac and Curetic worship of the more eastern Pelasgians,
I would rather seelr the etymology in the root λο-, hum, how,
so frequently occurring in the names of places and persons con-
nected with that worship¹‚ and expressing the devouring nature
of lire. It appears from the word Lar-va that the Lar was
represented a‘s a wide-mouthed figure. There ere two feminine
forms of the name, Lar-unda and Lar-entia. The former may
be compared with the Scythiae Temarunda and Anglo· saxon
Soerende (above, p. 60).

This enumeration of the names of Tuscan divinities shows
that, aa far astho terma cf mythology are concerned (and there
are few terms less mutabis), the Tuscan languagc does not ahso-
lutcly escape from the grasp of etymology. If the suggestion
thrown out cbove (ch. 11. ξ 22) respecting the parallelism be-
tween Tim and Tor is to be received, the easy analysis of these
mythical names isto be explained by the fect that they belonged
to the religion of southern Etrruia, which was Pelasgien rather
than Scandinavian. Many of the common words which have
boen handed down to us present similar traces of affinity to the
langnages'of the Indo-Germanic family. Iwill examine them
in alphabetical order ; though, unfortunately‚ they are not so
numerous as to assume the form of c comprehensive vocabulary
of the language.
