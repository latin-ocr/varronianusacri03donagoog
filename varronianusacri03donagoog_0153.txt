the Sabine language aa different from the Oscan, y'et, ,Al the
remains of the Sabine and Oscan languages belong to a'period
when the Sabellian conquerere had mixed themselves up with the
conquered Ausoniam and had learned their language, it seems
reasonable that we should not attempt, atthis distanee of time,
to discriminate between them, bnt that, recognining generally the .
original affinity of the limbrian and Osean natione, we should
consider the Sabine words which have been transmitted to ns, as
belonging, not so much to the Umbrian idiom, as to the complex
Sabello-Osean langusge, which prevailed throughout the whole of
southern Italy. And this view of the matter is further justified
by the fact, that a great many of these words are quoted, not
only as Sabine, bnt also as Oscan. It is true that some parti-
cnlar words are quoted aa Sabine, which are not found in Oscan
inscriptious, end not known to he Orcan ols03 but we cannot
form any general conclusione from anch isolated phenomena, espe-
cially aa a great many of these words are Latin as well. All
that they prore is simply this, that there were provincialisms in
the Sabine marry properly so called. Still less can we think
with Mtiller (mnes. 1. p. 42), that the Sabine language is the
un-Greele clement in the Osean3 for many of these words have
direct connexione with Greek synonyme, as Mttller himself has
admitted There are no Sabine Inscriptions as such. The Mar·
aian inscription, quoted by Lanai, and which Niebuhr thought
unintelligible (1. 105, cd aot. 333), is Ossan, if it ought not
rather to be called old Latin.

In the following observatione, then, for the materiale of which
Iam lurgely mooted to the writings os Professor Kleuae (Pet-
lohpaircte Abboadlaapea, Berlin, 1839), and oi Theodor Momm-
sen (Ueteritalr'ecbea Diolelcte Leipsig, 1850), the Sabine and
Oscan will be treated in conjunction with one another¹. Before
proceeding to consider the Osann inscriptions, it may. be as well
to give an alphabetical list oi those words which are cited by old
writers as Sabine, Oseen, or both. '
