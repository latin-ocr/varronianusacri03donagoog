Y never appeared until it accompanied z on the reetomtion 02 .
that consonant to the Romen franchise..

Althongh z appears in the Umbrian and Oscan monuments,
and though it occurred· ιιι the Salian sange (Velius Longus,
. p. new ‘Mihi videtur nec aliena sermoni fuisse zlittera, cum
inveniatur in carmine Saliari”), we find that, even in words
borrowed from the Greek, this letter is represented by di, as in
&budius sqr Σέβαζος (Apuleius, Met. vm. 170), judur'diare for
jndaizare (Commodiani, Inane. adv. Gent. c. xxxvn. 634),
trapeds'a for trapeea (Auctor. Bet. Ayrcr. p. 248), subtilia for
801288, oridia for ον288, &e (vide Schneid. Elameaturl. 1. p. 3863
and Lobeek, Aphropd. p. 296, note l). The fact seems to be,
thet the Romans hed two different characters to express the two
different values 02 the Greek z, which was a dental, either assi·
bileted (as δσ transposed in some dialects to σδ), οι sostened (as
by). Now, in its latter use it becomes equivalent to the softened
guttural3 for the dentel and guttural, when combined with y,
which is the ultimate vocalitation 02 the gutturals, converge in
the sound 02 cur j or ab (Neu Orat. §§ 112, 216). When, there·
fore, the Greek z more nearly approximates to the anund σδ,
either this is preserved in the Latin transcriptione, asin Mee-
deatiue, Ηᾶφῖισηω lor Mezentius, Zephyrus (Max. Victor. p. 1945);
or the δ 28 assimilated to the σ, 88 in 11288888ιί888, mussa, nante,

02 the two component parts is omitted, asin Sapuates lor br·
legatltua, or Medentdu for Mezentius. In this caee, too, we may
consider that the letter n occasionally steps in, ae 1¹¹, rabmby·· -ι ι, ,

the side 02 ἔρι[δ]ς. When, however, the Greek z is a saneta ⁸ .

δ, and therefore equivalent to a setena quaerat, we find that
itis represented either by the full combination dt, as in· the
cases quoted ebore, or else hythe vocalized guttural (j) only.
