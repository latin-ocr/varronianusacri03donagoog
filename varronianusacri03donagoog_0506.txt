denote a person or thing belonging to that from which the noun
ia derived; thus arr-idn] is the man ot' the curib, censueqn]
theman ot' the centur-ia, dcc. And as the genitive ended origi·
nally in -r'rn = -εἱὸη, we must comider these nouus in abraba-r κ
as extensione ol the genitive coac. The same explanation vvill
apply to the nouus in ·b[n], aa walda] from epum forthere
s is reason to believe (above, p. 350) that these forms have lost or
V absorbed an ι’. As the termination -a‘o, -air, ee, -trir, is parti-
culme appropriated to verbal nouus expressing the action of
the verb, we must conclude that the verhal nouus in ·r‘o, -ct'o,
-ta'o, are also derived from the genitive ol nouns in -t'o, -ar’e, dra.
And this will lead us to the meaning already suggested, namely,
that these words denote the result of an abstraction which hus

The important word relligio will lnrnish a good exemplifi-
Ἀ oetion of my meaning. There have bean two different opinions
with regard to the etymology ol this vord. For while most
modern scholare adopt the suggestion of Servius (od Vcrp. AEn.
v111. 349), Lactantius (rv. 28), and Augustin (Meet. 1. 13),
namely, that the word comes from relabere, supporting thia
view with the quotation from Lucretius (1. 931, IV. 7): “relli-
gionum nodab animos exsolvere;” Cicero makes relabere tha
main verb, end gives the following explanation (de Nat. Deor.
11. 28, fin.): “qui omnia, quae ad cultum deornm pertinerent,
ss diligenter retractarent et tamquam relegerent, sunt dicti relrjryrbei

'fs' in another pont of the same work, he says (itan. 11. 3, ξ Sl:
,⁵³ “relligio est quae superioris cujusdam naturae (quem divinam
, vocant) curam cerimoniamque affert.” This etymology is in
accordance with the verse quoted by Aul. Gell. 1v. 9: “reli-
gentam esse oportet, relligiosum netas-’² And there ean be no
doubt that it is perfectly true. It is clear from the use of the
word that vellignis is nqt derived from relegare, “to bind back,”
