p. 352). And as 732 is opposed to Ul? from ζιΡξ perforavit-
(a membri genitalia formo distinctabnia cocao aie dioto, Furat,
Omtcord. p. 727), we may conclude that it signifies: ὁ τρυπῶν,
(cf. AEsch. Fraym. Dan. 38: ἐρᾷ μὲν ἁγνὸς οὐρανὸς τρῶσαι
χθόνα). Be this as it may, it is clear that the root fop- is not
identical with the root naon,· and it is quite possible that man
should appear distinctively as “the protector,” as well as gene·
rally in the character of “thinker'’ and “indicatos'' There is
the same opposition with the same parallelism in ananan, the
hand, generally, and specially the right hand, as pointing out
and indicating‘ (cf. μην-ὐω, onon-strare, δεξ-ία, tela-vva, dte),
and ἀριστερὸς, the left hand, as carrying the weapon of defence
(Now Orat. ξ 162, note). The attributes os the goddess Feronia
are by no means accurately known: there seems, however, to
bc little doubt that she was an elementary goddess, and aa such
perhaps also a subterraneons deity, so that her name will be
connected with feralia, φθείρειν, defaecatam· dre. Ι

Λευκοθέα, “ the white goddess,’' had a Tusean representative
in the Mater matuta, “mother of the morning,” whose attribute
is referred to in the Greek name, which designatas the pale
silvery light of the early dawn. Both goddesses were probably
also identical with Εἰλείθυια, Lacino, the divinity who brought
children from the darkness of the womb into the light of lif.
Sotbina, a name which occurs in Etmscan monuments (Lausi, 11.
p. 494), is probably the Etruscan transcription of the Greek
Σοωδίνα (“ saving from child-bed pains”), which was an epithet
of Artemis (see Bitckh, Gorya. Iacer. nc. 1595).

Apollo was an adopted Greek name, the Tnscan form being
Apulo, Aple, Epul, or Epora. If the “ custos Soractis Apollo,”
to whom the learned Virgil (AEn. xt. 786) makes a Tusean
pray, was a native Etruscan god, then his name Soranus, and
the name of the mountain Soracte, must be Tuscan words, and
contain the Latin eol, with the change from l tor observable in
the form Epora for Epnl: compare also the Sanscr. aceyo. 1

Although Neptunus was an important god in the Tuscan
pantheon, it is by no means certain that this was the Tuscan
form of his name: if it was, then we have another Tuscan word
easily explicable from the roots of the Indo-Germanic langnage;
for Nep-tunae is clearly connected with νέω, Napeae, νίπτω, dre.
