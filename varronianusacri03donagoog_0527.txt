between the two classes cf verbs is well shown by the contrasted
use cf mullo and assideo, the form ol which denotas the mere
act of taking a seat (Terent. Heuut. 1. 1, 72: wido: occumat
sevi: coccos hedum), while the latter implies the continuance ’
of sitting, cs of a mother-bird by its unfledged young (Hor.
Epod. 1. 19: midam implumibus pelleir corb), or of the usual
messor cn the seat of justice (Tacit. Ana. 1. 57).
Verbs in 1 are derived ironr nouus of the 1 declension. Thus

we have

caetra . . . . carrinam}

finire .. . . . . fiais

lenire . . . . lomb

mollire . . . . mollis

vestire . . . . . oeett'e

When we seem to have an exception to this rulo, we cun
always find, cn looking into the question, that the crude form of
the noun, from which the verb in e’is derived, does involve this
letter. Thus we have sepire from sepe, which is really an ι’
noun3 punire is from prena, but the Greek ποινή = ποι-νμ, and
the adjective imponi-s, show that the form ends in ι’, nwlirc'
comes from moles=mole·ie,· sortiri from sors=sor-ti·s, gen. pl.
sorti-um and blandiri is referred to blundus, which is really
the participle of bl[a]0=fl[a]o, “to breathe or hlow gently”
(cf. palantis, μαλ-θα-κός, &c.); such phrases as ludendos prece
vel hostio, “ scothing with prayer,” or “ sacrifice’' (Hor. lEp. 1.
135. Oarm. 111. 23, 18), whence we have hdvndoe precer (id.
Oarm. lv. 1, 8. A. P. 395), still retain the participial meaning3
'and this ls presumed in the adverb blanditer (Plaut. Acin. 1.
3, 69), so that the true form is blan-tis, whence blood-iri.

. Verbs in U, when this amounts to eya, are derived from

nouus in u. Thus wchave

acuere · . . . acu -
metuere . . . . metas '‚
trtbtcere . . . . tribus

This may be regarded as a singular case; for no contractionis

possible in a derivative verb of this kind.
There are cf course many verbs in -a0‚ which are not deriva-
' tive; thus prae involved in ocu-qruo, “to dash cr clssh toge-
