reuomentem, &e with lanne, serment, &e Itis neglected in
the same lenguege when it stands between two vowels ,especially
when one or both are ιι (ο) or ι compare opimio, corbrcadr,
focus, yeme, locus, eccere, paucus, ιιιιι, dm. with atelle, cor-
‚ills beille ‚jeus ιιι, lieri) ιιιιιιιι, peu, fois, &e An omission os ιιιιῖί·
hard o is sometimes stmngely compensated by the introduction esua« t
oso before ι thus we have pom from prs, Poitiere from Pie-
ιοιιιι, &e We must distinguish this from foyer by the side of
focus which hes an ο already.

In some cases the French converts the tenuis c into the
mediel e. Compare αι’φιι, αιιιιρῖι, moiyre, &e with agar, “eae
αόοοιιῐιιι, mocar &ch ΝΜ* .

eis often omitted ιιι the middle of French words. compare ,
Augustus, Augustodunum, Brigantio, lugdunum, legere, Ιιίθι-
nt, moyse, magister, niger, paganus, regino, dcc. with Aoat,
Αιιιιιιι ‚Briunoom Lyca, and Luco, lira, Ιιοίιιι, ιιιαιι, mettre, noir,
potam reim, &e Similarly, we heve dots or dois (durium) from
daffle= -sduch 1..e the cenopy over the high tsble' in the hall.

⁴ Compare eleo our pronunciation of Auqmtia es Austris, end of
Maqdclcn as Moudlt'a. The same omission took place in old
Latin; thus we find ιηιιιιτ- maye-pe.

The Freneh end [taliane generally neglect the gutturel Η.
The old hard sound ol this aspirate is quite unknown to them.

Although the sibilent is in some cases ehin to the dental
class, the Latin sibilante x and s must be considered es belong·

ι ing altogether to the gutturals. The Romans had ι dental eibi·
lnnt in their ιι, of which I shall speek directly; but these two
seem to heve in themselves no connexion with the dentale, be-
yond the circumstance thet ιι is frequently derived from shy the
substitution ola dental articulation, in the same way as Ostende
for σ in θάλασσα lor σάλισσιι, dcc„ and as the lisping English·
man says yetb for ιιι.

If we consider x in ite common acceptation, it is a direct
combination of the guthrral 'e or e with the sibilant s. This
must, of course, be its power in ιιιιι, flexi, &e But it wcs
not always equivalent to this combination either in sonnd or in
origin. Sometimes it stands lor the dentel ξε dj, as in ιιιι ι l -·
compared with ἔριδ-ς, ἐρίζοι, &e And even when it was derived
immediately from a guttural and s, the sibilant seems to hare
