pp. 92, sqq.), and the sama practice is often remarlred in latin.
Indead, as we have scen above (p. 98), the elongated form is
the more ancient and original. Ahalam, then, bears the same
relation to the Latin alter that ahala bears to ala, cabil to
albachermarca to aenens, &a Itis true that in the Engubinc
Tables atre seems to represent the meaning, if not the form of
altem but this is no reason why there should not bc the other
equally genuine and ancient form alter or chalcen which is pro-
bably the more emphatic word in that language, and corrc·
sponds, perhaps, in meaning to the adjective aliem. Tho sig·
nification of the word pepe suggests itsclf from the context, and
is also supported by analogy. It seems to be a reduplication of ἵ
the root pa (pet-nab, psa-sm, πασάσθαι, vra-riom, dac), analo· 3
gons to the reduplication of the root bi (or pi, πί-ὐω, duc.) in
bi-bo. If the Sabinos were a warrior tribe of Umbrians, it is 3
reasonable to conclude that their name·for “a warrior'' would
be Umbrian also; now ve know that the Sabine name for “a

- warrior” was titas (Fest. p. 366, and above, p. 32), and thc

warrior tribe at Rome was called the Titienses (Liv. 1. 13); ac·
cordingly, as the Umbrian Propertius calls these the Tities (Et
iv. 1, 31: Hinc Tities Ramnesque ciri Luceresque cabad), itis
not an nnfair assumption that titas, pl. sities, was tha Umbrian
word for “ a warrior.” We have the same word on an Etruscan
monument from Voltcrra, which represents a warrior with sword
and spear, and bears the following. legend: mi aflles Tites
(Inghirami Mon. Etr. ser. VI. tao. A.; Micali Ant. Mon. tac. 51;
Miiller, Dcnbmdler,1.n1. n. 312). Tha inscription, then, will
run thus: ‘⁴ the warrior ests anothcr’s bread;” the· position of
ahaim being justified by the emphasis which naturally falls
upon it. Compare Dante, Pacadcbo, xvu. 58-60:
Tu proverai sl comesa di sala

Iro scandere a'l sallr per l' derat scale.

This motto, then, either refers to the practice ol sarving as
mercenariae, so common among the Italians, or expresses the
prouder feeling of superiority to the mere agriculturist, which
