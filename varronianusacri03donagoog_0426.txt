jugam, jepta, and the crude form of sto. Like eoa-tinae it ex-
presses contiguity. Some consonante] affin, equivaleut toa
case-enffing, is inrolrfed in the last syllable. The old gram-
marians remark that ‘⁴ ataobr pro sternier primam producit; pro

a’lla'co corripit ;” and such forms as saoce, oa, prove that the ᾗ

contractionis not always exhibited. But the aualogy of ‹laa-
μίψδην, ἅνα-μῦγτδα, dod-pura, ἀνά-μιξ (Greek Grammar, Art.
265), shows that some affix was to be expected, aud that it
might be extenuated into a mere vocal Anahrut. From the
almost synonymous anas aud ἑξῆς, compared with the ablativos
iu e for cd, and with ονρᾶῷ) by the side of spi-har, we can easily
infer the nature of the appeudage which has been rubbed off
from the prepositional adverb japeto :japeto-tim.

It may be worth while to add that prepositions componnded
with verbs are liable to certain changes from assimilation or
absorption‚ which perhaps typify a similar change in the seperate
use of these proclitic words. .

A, ab, aba may appear as aa, and we have seen it assume the
form as in old Latin (above, p. 260, l. 11).

Ad may change dinto the first letter of the word with which it
is eompouuded3 thus it may become aa, af, up, al, aa, ap, ar,
oa, aa· aud wc bare seen that the last of these represents oue
of its separate usages; compare also at, aud the Greek ἔτι.
This preposition is represented by a short ἄ in &perh = ad·

Acte sometimes appears as antid, which may hare been its ¹
original form (see abore, p. 365).

Circum may lose its final m or change it into a.

Gran appears as com, ao, ool, coa, or cor.

De either remains unaltered, or assumes the form das before t;
-it is found also with a different, but cognate signification, as
dae, df, dif- and dira

Ε, ωε, enters into compounds either in its separate form, or assi-
milated to f, as in fffm·

In is im before labials, ἰ before 9, il aud ab· before the liquide
l aud r, but otherwise anchanged3 in old writers or their
imitatore we have endo οι· obdu.
