primm their genitive plural in -nm and are therefore independent
of any additional elementa, adjectivae of the same form show by
their ablativo in -ί and their genitive plural in eam, that the
lull ending of their crude formis not c-, bnt cai It has bem
already remarked that some noune in b-, c-, γ, or t· (d) either
have by-fonna in -ti, -oi-, pt, cr -tr'-, cr must have been origi-
nally formed in I. The shortened form ia confined to the singular
number, for the gen. pl. is invariably in ·Iam. Auditis tc be
observed that the syncope generally takes place in nonna in
which a mute is preceded either hythe liquid a or r, or hy a
long vowel. Thus we have mara for camb, fronde for fraude,
orbs for arbria, pars for partis, mercior moth, a number cf
nouns in -os, -ce, -r'e‚ for -atais, -etrh, aab, as crp'os sor cajetae,
Ooeres for Geretae cr Ooera'ttir, Samnio for Samnitai, the longer
forms ol the latter being still found in the older poets¹, and a
class of nonna in -al and -ar for -ola and are, as cathaelfar ‹mi-
meh, pulvinar for pulvinare. There are, however, not a few
nonus which are liable tc the same syncope, though the penul-
tina in thc original form was short3 thus we have accho for acchab,
saa forfacto, caro(c) lor aaron, par forparsb, celer lor celera, adeps
for adapta acl (when masc.) l'or salah, dm. The appearance of
-cta‘- instead cf aaa, cs the characteristic formation of the parti-
ciple, connecto itaelf with a very interesting fact-namely, that
forms in -ntc in Greek and Latin stand bmide forms in mnas and
adusi From the regular change of -ντς ἱη Greek into -atnc in
Latin-as when wc have πᾶςΞ πάντ-ς by the side of parantraa, cr
poa⁸= Τάραντ-ς by the eide of Tarentum-no inference can be
drawn. But as -d- is generally, ir* nct always, a shortencd form
of the articulatiou which appears as the second personal proncnn
and the second numeral, and aa wc have verbal forms in dae
(aa cupidae, dcc.) by the side cf verbale in wenc, -τύς, -τις, it is
not unreasonable tc conclude that if arian-te =oria-n-dus, the
former isan abridgment of maha-tis analogous to samotra dic,
and this explains the genitive plural in -t'cna Although there

¹'l’ha original form is alac indicated by tbe occant, scr, although
Latin words ara generally barytcna, nonus ln ·‹t(t)a have the acceut on
the last syllable just like those which hara an apocopated enclitic, aa
circamanentes. ·
