526 wsnnomon nnn causemur [cunr. ἰιι

The mood of carrea shows that the emphatic a'llom would be as
out of placa here, as it is appropriate in the following line. And
do, which we should hare expected in the first inatame (cf.
Andr. 1. 5, 60; ιι. 2, 15) has beau turned into dabo, partly
from a confusion ¹between the readings dopoetlam and doborllom
aud partly by an anticipation of dabo in w. 19. With regard to
tb'e monosyllabic a· for tibi, the Romans frequently omitted h in
the middle of a word: this is most common iu the dat aud abl.
pl. of the first declension, and is also observable in the Freuoh
derivatives3 such as oa and y from aei audibi. For the change
of puer into por, we may also compare the transfor-motion of
saera and fierent into fore, forem.

Perhaps two of the most striking instances of this elipt pro*
nunciation are atiorded by the scansion of the partiales quadem
and modo, in both of which the d is omitted. With regnrd to
the former even Bentley remarked that it must be frequently a
monosyllable iu Terence (od Andr. 1. 3, 20), and Ritsehl (Proleq.
pp. cxl. sqq. cnm.) and Fleckeisen (N. Jahrb. nx. 260) have
shown that this was the ease in Plautus. The following reasons
have been adduoed to prore that it was so in general. (1) The
analogy of iterra shortened from itidem, will support the pronun·
ciation of pal-em for quoidam. (2) As itis an enclitic, andis
regularly attached to certain words, in the same way as περ, γε,
duc. in Greek, it seems reasonable to suppose that it would be
pecoliarly liable tc eurtailment. Itis argued therefore, that if
we retain the full form of quidem with some ol these words, we
alter their quantity, and so sacrifice the principal word in order
to preserve a mere appendage. Thus epo-quiden, or omnim
is marked equidem in books on Latin prosody, and siquidem,
quandoquidem are marked siquidem, quampridem, although the
true quantity of the separate words is at, quood& and though in
other compoonds--qnondepna peccatricemque—this quantity is
invariably retained. Hence it is inferred that quandoquidem
must bave been pronouneed quondcqu'em5 siquidem, atquem
and quidem, eqa’ems and that me quidem must he scanned me
pu'em in Pers. 1. 110. But although there is reason to believe
that quidem was either a monosyllablc or two very short syl-
lables in the colloquial Latin of the comedians (sacenses,
11. p. 93), hir Merivalc has properly remarked (od stollam. Oo-
