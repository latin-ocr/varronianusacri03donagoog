dian introduces one of these public servants on the stage, we
might expect that, ‚as he imitatos the broad dialecto of the Boso-
tians and Megarians, and tbo pure Doric cf the Spartans, he
would also give an accurate representation of the broken Greek
of these barbarian functionaries¹. When we mimio the provin·
cialisms of the Higblanders or the Wclsh, we are carefrrl to
substitute tenues for medials3 and in tbe same way, we may
suppose, Aristophanes would represent the leading peculiarities
of the Scythian pronunciation of Greek. Now we find that bis
scythim bowman in the timerem consistently omits
the final -r or -ν of Greek words, substitutos the lenis for the
aspirato, and once puts ξ fot sigma We should expect, there-
fore, that the Scythian langnage would present us with Viror-
9ah and sumserat, would repudiate aspiratcd consonants, and
employ f=ah instead of the ordinary sibilant. While this is
the case with the fragments of the Scythian langaage which still
remain, it is even more remarkable in the old idioma of Italy.
In fact, these peculiarities constituto, as we shall see in the
soquel, some of the leading features by which the Italian lan·
gunges are distinguished from the dialems of ancient Greek.

ξ 10. Names ofthc Scythica rivers derived aad esphiaed.

The names of the Scythian rivers, which Herodotus enu-
meratos, will first engage our attention. These names are mate·
rially corrupted by the Greek manscripticm bnt with the help
of the general principles, which have just been stated, we shall
be ableto analyze them without much difficulty.

Beginning from the European side, the first of these rivers
ia the Ia-ter, or, as it is now called, the Dori-ca or Dan-ahc. If

we follow the analogy of our own and other countries, we shall -

,observo that local names very osten consist of synonymous
