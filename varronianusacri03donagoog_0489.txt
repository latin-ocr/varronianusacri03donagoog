meaning flows from that ot‘ leaving to be done by others: lor
the master or employer by leaving undone presumes the active
employment ol his substitute. A further modificaticn is occa·
sioned by a transference of person; and an action is predicated
with reference to its object, as when a German says sicle latren
laeam of a man who makes a speech, and lats others hear him,
or when a Roman says qaeu-so, “I let another person speak,”
meaning “I put a question to him.” The general signification
of so for aare, in compounds like ar-ccaeo, “I br approach,”
i. e. “1 send for,” capesso, “I let myself take,‘’ i.e.“1under-
take,” dcc, has been shown in the last chapter, where it has
been adduced as an illustrationes the composite tenses os the
regular verb. It is rather ‘remarkable that Bopp, who first
suggested the true explanationes the composite tenses, and*
whom I have had to censure on more than one oceasion¹ for
a theory of agglutinata forms carried beyond the reasonable
limits of philological deductim, should still be among the num-
ber of those who are unable to see that the verbs in -sao, -ssr'ea'
involve the addition of aaa. He would compare these forms
with the Senserit denominatives in syc, coya, and with certain
imitatione of the Greek derivative verbs such as atticano, pa-
trisso, dre. (Verqbet. Gramen. §7 7 5, p. 1066). But in the latter
ease, the verb is always of the first conjugation in -c, and not
only have wc correspondiug forms in'-zo direetly derived from
the Greek (aspctrizc for petraeae), but we know that ss gene·
rally stands for a Greek ζ (above, p. 97). Besides, we cannot
explain any⁸ of the verbs under consideration as desiderative
forms, and il the obvious analysis of arcesso with its two ortho-
graphica, and queso, with its included quc-ere from [in]-qaom,
were not sufficient to demonstrate that the -so, -ac'ei stands
for sino, aiei, we could appeal to a ease in which the verb
eino, independently compcunded with a preposition, has suf-
fered a still more striking mutilation. There ean hardly, I
think, be a doubt that pri-no, (prael, stands for poa-nm and
as the perfect occurs under the form petivi, as in Pleut. Tri·
