first syllable, he supposes, contains the root pra, implying growth
and nonrishment, and found in the Sanscr. pro-ora (signifying
either “a hard of feeding cattle”—9rom—or osma inter ραεαια),
in the Lat. prdaemea, in the Goth. pras, and in the Old N arse
praemissam. Lassen, too, suggests that Gradivus contains
the same root This comparison ought perhaps to have led him
to the true explanation of both words. For it is manifest that
Gru-diam procia or grandis Diuus,· and it is equally certain
that no genuina Latin compound begins with averbal root. If,
therefore, (iro-domm contains the root of bos, bova, the first
syllable must be the clement of tha adjective pravas or prandeis,-
so that &adocias will be a compound of the same kind as
natamdpdevoe (sce Lobeck, Paralia. p. 372). Pott, however,
(m. Foracd. 11. p. 201) considers Grai-ocius as another form
of Greci-lomus.

lio. or treis bus is either boam tres or dodra trabas. If we
have bere the accna plural, we must conclude that this ease in
the Umbriam langnage ends in -uf, -os, -aj, -ejJ -ᾔ -eaJfi according
to the stem3 and the labial termination has been compared with
the Sanscrit and Zend change oss into a at the end of a word
(wilkins, ἓ 51; Bopp, § 76). This is the opinion of Lassen
(letata Mus. 1833, p. 377). According to Lepsius and Grou-
fend, on the other hand, all these words are ablativae, because
the termination ia more easily explained on this hypothesis, and
because verbs signifying “to sacrifice” are construed with the
ablativo in good Latin (Virg. Eelop. 111. 77; Hor. Cam. 1.4,
11). The latter reason is confuted by the tables themselvea3
for it is quita clear that αὖτωιε isan accusative, like the Gothic
asyam, and yet we have both ebroas sulcarent (vn. a, 43) and
abroffetu (VII. a, 3). See also Pott, Et. Foraclr. 11. p. 202.
With regard to the form, it is not explained by the Senserit ana·
logies cited by Lassen, for these spring from tha charged aster o,
as in Romal, Rdmau, Edono. There is a much simpler way of

bringing abros and abrasa into harmony. For the plural is
formed from the singular by adding s to the latter. If then the
accusative singular assumed the form a from m, this would be

retained before a, as in adron-u but if abrae-s passed by obar-
yab into abram-l, this, according to the Celtic articulation, would
regularly bacam obrof; for in Celtic mh and bh are regularly
