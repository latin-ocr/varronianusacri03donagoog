the number of oompound or auxiliary tenses is very much in·
'oreased in the Romanoa as compared with tha Latin verb. In
addition to the verbs eam end fiai, we find that habeo and ato
are regularly preascd into the service. Verba in their first for-
mation construet their perfect and future tenses with the aid ol
labem for the past participle with labeo makes up the former
(as sai aine = eqo tacco amawm), and the regular futare con-
sists of a combination of the same verb with the infinitiva (as
jaima-aium labeo amore). This analysis οἱ the Romanoa
¹future was probably known to Sainte Palaye, who cites the main
proof of it, namely, the lact that the infinitiva was sometimes
separated from its auxiliary by the interposition of another word
·(see Bopp, Annae of ortena! Mamm, p. 45). But tho
formal enunciation of this view was first made by Raynonard
(sec Grammoc're Ronmae, p. 2213 Lcwis Oa tlte Romanae
Laepuayea, p. 194); aird there cannot be the least doubt of its
truth. This is shown not only by the tmereb, to which I have
referred, but also by the varying forma of the future in the dis·
ferent Romanoa langnages, which correspond to the varieties
in the torm of the present of tabere. Thus, on the one hand,
we find: “ et quant cobrat lactan, toracr l’aa e so podcr per fe
e senes engan” = ‘tet quand recourro l'auront, warner l'oat en
