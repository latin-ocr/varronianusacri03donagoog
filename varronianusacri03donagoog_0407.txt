crcy'na is merely the adjective cayna, with a fixed inflexion like the
—orirn’ of the passive verb, is objectionable, as vvcll on other ao·
conum, as because it ia contrary to the analogy of mei, toi, roi,
which exhibit the genitives of the possessive pronoun. The long
iiu occa isos course dne to the absorption of a previous vowel,
and the same must be the case with the Senserit possessives iu
tyn. The short n of the termination is illustrated by every
complete analogy. There can be no doubt that ἕως re, ἔς reond
tta-qne spring from acommon origin ; and thus sve sce at once
that thc terminatione of cnyin and πόλ-εως are identical.

’ The guttural Acinetos the Latin relative aud interrogative
is lost in nbi, υηιῖο (cl. alioci, ali-weda), ran-qnam (cf. -cnnqneh
aar (cf. κόπρος), dre.

Extemions of the relative or interrogative form indefinite οι· v

indefinite-relative pronaum, which are accurately distinguished
hythe best writers. Thus aliquis = olins-qnia or ille-quta, and
qni-dom, denote “some one in particular,” though the objectis
not named3 quola-qno means “ every one;'' qnae-qnia and qni-
cnnqne “whosoever;’' φιιί-υιὶο and qni-lohet, “any you please;''
quaequam and its adjective nllus = nonina “ any at all.’' Hence
the words in the first gronp are obscurely definite; quaeqae,
gerhoch, and ,quicunqne include all persons or things referred to;
’ quiea and qnihhet allow an nnlimited range of choice; and qnia·
qnam and nilne exclude all the objecta specilied. As a general
rule, while qunque has never the relative-indefinite signification,
but always, like the Greek ἕκαστος, arderes, dcc. refers to the
antecedent in the sense of “ every ’² ‘⁶ each,’' quisquis is synony-
mous with quicunqne, ὅστις, “ whoever,” and is virtually used aa
a relative pronoun. There are however exceptione to this, end
quiaquia is used in the sense cf quaeque. Thus iu Cicero (ad
Fatnit. v1. 1, ξ l)r quocunqne in loco quiaquia eat, idem eat cc’
meuc et ecdem wodstoc ea interito rerumpublicarum et moram,
we have qnirqct's used in exactly the same sense aa quoique in
Epist. 4, §3 of the same book: ot ndi queisque ait, iot minime
ecee colit. And we have the two forms together in the same
senae in the Leo> Thoria (above, p. 282): t'to atei qtoquid
quotaque onte hono legem rogatam licea In the neuter modern
scholare propose to distingnich the less common meaning of·

an’oqatid =quzuqne from the ordinary meaning ol quidquid= quodq
