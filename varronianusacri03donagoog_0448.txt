end infinitive; and according to this arrangement, the present
subjunctive Latin answers to the Greek conjunctive, while the
imperfect subjunctive Latin finds its equivalent in the optative of
the Greek verb: for instance, scribo, ct drama corresponds to
γράφω, ἵνα meddam, andcecre‘pei ut decem to ἔγραψα, ἵνα
μανθάνοιο. If, however, we extend the syntactical compariscn a
little farther, we shall perhaps be induced to conclude that there
is not always the same model distinction between the Latin in-
dicative end subjunctive which we find in the opposition of the
Greek indicative to the conjunctive÷optstive Thus, to take
etue or two instances, among many which might be adduced, one
cf the first lessons which the Greek student has to learn is,
to distinguish accurately between the four ceses of protasis and
spodosis, and, among these, more especially between the third,
in which two optatives are‘used, and the fourth, iu which two
past tenses of the indicative are employed¹. Now the Latin
syntax makes no such distinction between the third and fourth

ceses, only taking care in the fourth case to use pest tenses, and

in the third case, where the hypothesis is possible, to employ κ

present tenses of the subjunctive moed. Thus, e. g, in the third
case: εἰ loc nunc eocefyrari velim, nse dice, eoa, latera de·
ficieot,· where we should have in Greek: εἰ τοῦτο ἐν τῷ

παραυτίκα «γεγωνεῖν ἐθέλοιμι, ἡμέρας ἄν μοι καὶ φωνῆς καὶ

¹ ¹This is, indeed, a very simple and obvious matters but it maybe
convenient to some readers, if Insubjoin a tabular comparison of the
Greek and liatin usages in this respect. The classiflcation is honored
from Buttmann’s mttere Grumentum 109 (p. ³94, Lachmann’s edi·

The distinction between cases (3) and (4) is'also observed in the expres-
sion of a wiah: thus, adeam aalma sir! pronounoes nc opinion respect-
