arctatam comp. Varro, L. L. vr1.§26. We may perhaps
recognize the same root in a-moenoa Lithuan. aimecna's.

, Moatrba, “weighing-mect.” Feat. p. 132: “ Mantabo addite-

mentnm dicitur lingna Tusca, quod ponderi adicibrr, sed dete-
rius et quod sine ullo usn est. Lucilius: mantica obsonia
awa? Scaliger and Voss derive it from mano-tenca, “eo
qnod manu porrigitur.’‘ It is more probably connected, like
naen-do, with the root of μάτην; compare flentum with
firoetro.

Nonae, “the pigmy.” Lycophr. Aloe. 1244: Νάνας πλαναῖσι
πάντ’ ἔρωνήσας μυχόν. Ubi Tzetzes: ὁ Ὀδυσσεὺς παρὰ τοῖς
Τυρσηνοῖς νάνος καλεῖται, δηλοῦιπος τοῦ ὀνόματος τὸν πλανή-
την. This interpretation seems to be onlya guess based on
the πλαναῖσι of Lycophron. The considerations mentioned
above (§ 1) leave it scarcely doubtful that the Tuscan word,
like the Latin nance, refers to the diminutive stature of the
hero, which is also implied in his common name Ulyacea The
Greek words νάνος, vdwoe, νάνισκος, verdier, νάνιον, dic. have
the same meaning. The word, therefore, being common to
the Tuscans, Greeks, and Romans, is indubitebly of Pelasgie
orrgrn.

Napoa, “ a profligate.” Fest. p. 165: ‘⁶ Nepos luxuriosus a Tus·
cis dicitur.'’ Probably, as Muller suggests (Etroalc. 1. p. 277),
the word which bears this meaning is not from the same root
as the Siculian beyron, “a grandson” (Gr. νέπους, ἀ-νέψιος,
Germ. oeffe). Many etymologica heve been proposed3 butI
am not satisfied with any one of them. Might we connect
the word with oe-pdtrir, Gr. ἅ-κρατής, detramur?

Plnrmtoe :ficher-ictor. See the Inacraptio titioque quoted
abore s. r, Horucpeoe. We must consider this huson word
aa standing either for Foro-tactim or for fislotocr'ua: in the
former case it is connected with the Latin flamna, ficano,
Greek πῦρ, Germ. sear, dre, Old Norse fin· or fyr,· in the
latter it may be compared with fiel-900, fill-men, phe-‘y-ecv,
φλόξ, dec. It is not impossible that both root· may be ulti·
mately identical: compare creber, celeber; crocco, glisco ;
κραῧροψ, καλαῦροψς ema, (1-κῶοῆ culmen, cehua, κολο-
φών, κράνιον, κορυφή, &c ; but the rbrings the word neerer
to the Old Norse, which the theory would lead us to expect,
