duced three additional characters, namely, an invented digammay
to give the sound of a in acrone and culpus (Quintil. 1. 4, ξῖ), the
antisigma) or :tc to represent the Greek ψ or the combination
ba, pa‚· and the Oscan I', which resembled in form thc Greek spri-
ritus asper Ι· (above, p. 99), to represent the sound between iand
a(Quintil. 1. 4, ἓ 8: medius U etI litterae eonas). But although

letters in his lifetime, they soon became obsolete (Tacit. Ana. 11.
14), andare found on only a lew monuments (Cometen, 1. pp. 13,
14). In its latest form, as recognized by Priscian, the Latin
alphabet consisted of the 23 letters, which it comprised when the
Y and Z were added.

If we omit the supernumeraries C, K, Y, Z, and distribute
the nineteen genulne and necessary letters according to their
natural or organic classification, we shall have the following
