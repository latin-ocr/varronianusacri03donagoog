or action-the object to which something is promding. Now
the Latin, in most instances, is unable to express this simple
relation of uode, obi ond quo by the mere case-endings. If we

. except certain sdverbs derived from nonne, certain agglutinato

forms, such as modic, postnilie, dte, some few nonos, os roo,
domm hornus, bellum, militia, and the proper names of citios,
we baveno locative in Latin, and no ease for the simple expres-
sion of departure or approach, and arc obliged to use propositione,
such as io, ob, ad, to convcy these meanings. And even with
regard to the forms which are still used as locatives, differenoes
of declension produce endless confusions, which all the old and
some modern grammarians have enhanoed by making arbitrary
rules sor differences of case in the syntax os different declensions.
Thus because nonns in ·o‚ no, of the first and second declen·
sion‚ had elocative in ·a·e'= te, and in -o-e' = t, we ore told that
militie, Rornoe, domi, Cypri are genitive cases3 whereas rori,
Carthagine, nonnis are ablativos, because the locetive approxi-
mates or corresponds to the mutilsted ablativa in the consonantal
deciension. These labourers in the work of making' the Latin
language nnlearnable, except hythe parret use of the memory‚
could not perceivs that es dies is masculine when it means “a
day,’' ht-dr'e andpootrt-deb must belong to the same forms, and
that if the former is from ho-i-die, the latter must be from
postero-idio. The same remark applies to meridie for medii dte,
and independently of these qnasi-componnds we have the phrases
die septimi (Plautus, Meo. 1156), die noni in the Praetor’s words
cited hy Aul. Gellius (x. 24). Also dio proximi (Cato), dc
croetehe' (Plautus, Mostell. 884), dte. The connexion of hd-dr‘e
for Iri-dec or toi-die (cf. hec) with these locatives in -ῑ supports
the true etymology of vnn-dommac, to which we are led by
the synonymous or-do (see Philol. Soot'ety’a team.1854,pp.9v
sqq.). It seems, however, that even this form in e'or oi does not
give the complete affix of the locative. Originally it must have
ended in -io or -e'm, ond this was corrupted in every form with
the exception of such words as partim, enim, &c.; hence, to
restore the original ending, we must write, with different degreex
of alteration or addition, mititte-im (nh), mma-im (-in), domo-im
(ὧι), Cypro-im (dn), rur-im (ab), Carthagine-im hin), Attend-
ὑπ l-in). With this locative in -m the preposition curn is used
