' These views of the Cyclopean architecture, as distinetively
characterizing the Pelasgians, are confirmed by all that we know
ot* their religions system. The worship of the Pelasgians was
not only elementary3 it not only consisted in an adoration of the
· great objecto of nature—for this was common to them with other
primitive tribes ;-but it was especially a eun-worship, like that
of the Medes, from whom, as we shall see, they mooe their legi-
timate desoent. Thus, while the so-called ohoriqc'noe ol Italy
worshipped Saturum-Ope, the divinity of the earth¹, the Pelasgo-
Tyrrheniam who dwelt beside them worshipped Tr'oa or Jonas,
the God of light. The two tribes, who constituted the original
