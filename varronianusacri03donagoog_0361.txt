In ordinary Latin the ablativa is used as the case of instru-
mentality in both numbers ς andin the plural there is no dis-
tinction between it and the dative. The specimens of old Latin
in Chapter vr. (cf. also the examples given by Corssen, Auepr.
Voleol. a. Betoa. 1. pp. 72, 334) heve sufficiently shown that the
termination of the ablative was -d, or, perhaps, at one period of
the lenguuge‚ ·t. The instrumental ending in Senserit is, as we
have scen, -iuu ,· end the Senserit ablative ended, like the Latin, .
in ·d. The tendency of the instrumenta] and ablativa-the case
of proximity end the case of derivation‚—to interchenge their
significatione, is a phenomenon, in which the philosophica] grem·
marian finds no difficulty. The fact that cirre and sed are so
nearly synonymous is an obvious exemphficition of this ten·
dency. It is a more serious imperfection of the Latin case·
system that the ablativa, though distinguished in form from the
genitive, should sometimes agree with it in meaning, and some-
times coincide in sense with its direct opposite the dative. With
regard to the singular number, which has an ablativa properly
so called, there can he no doubt that in Latin and Senserit, as
well as in Greek, the genitive end ablative ere traceable toa

' common origin. 'Phe full, original, and proper form of the geni·

tive singular was -sabn, and this in Greek often appeared as
-devr cf. Oedc=oede In Senserit the ablativo milret bears the
seme relation to the genitive wildepa that the genitive πόλεως
does to a more ancient πολιόσιον, or the adverb roheis to an ori-
ginal καλο-θεν, or the common τύπτεις to the inevitably assumed
τύπτε-σι. It is well known that the Latin adverbs in -tua cor·
respond to the Greek in ·0w; thus celitua=oripav6=0ev3 and
the Greek termination δ- iu -dnc, &c involves this ending -θεν

. (illeso Orat. ξ 263). There is therefore every reason to believe

that the Latin ablativo in -d or -t is an apocopeted form of a
case in -due or -tua which is resolveble to en ultimae identity
with the genitive.
