(a) Adrerbs in e or o, anciently ending in -ed, or -od, are,
in fact, ablative cases of adjectires: thus calda, originally vali-
dod ,· deae, originally besod· cito, originally cited3 certe or certo,
originally certod, duc, are the ablativo cases of calcidae, donna,
citus, centu, &c respectively. The Greeks had a large class of
adverbs of the same kind3 but in these the final -d of the abla-
tive has been soltencd down, according to the lawa of Hellenism,
into an -ςτ thus, οὕτως, καλῶς, &a represent the old forms of

the ablativo, oilrod, καλὸδ, doe. (see N. (hat. § 249). There are

two cases where this δ- seems still to exist, ttae and Ἀφροδίτη
(Sanscr. Ablata-imp and there is one instance in which the

metre of Homer will not allow its modern representative to 1

stand, namely, in those passages where ἕως is a trochce. The
Senserit tdoot compared with re'lcrc might justily the supposi-
tion that the original form was dio& while the analogy of λαὶός,
siloc, νάος, νέως, should authorize ns to insert, eren in our Hel·
lenic text of Homer, the emendation ‹iloc for ἕως (comp. also
'Hoc Αὕως, Ἕως), whenever this particle is a trochee¹.

(b) The termination ·tcr is appended to adjectivae of the

assu aserenam ln the samewaya} [a] s affixedtoadjcctives

of the first and second declension. Thus, from harh we have
leni-ter,· from promi, pravi-tem· from filie, fiducita& from
audac, audac-tm from difficilia, difficaltcm and so on. Tc thcse

must be added the isolated form igi-tar, which, according to l
’ Festus (p 105, Mttller) is equivalent to iada, postca, tum (abore,
p. 242); and which is used by Plautus (Miles θὼν. 111. 1, 177) l
as the antecedent to quondm for he says: “quando habebo, ³
igitur rationem mearum fabricarum dabo.'' The first two sylla· l

bles ὑφ’ must be taken to represent the composite form c-po,

alo, eja, dcc, of which the Ossan ea‘o is a softer form: and as

1 There can ba little doubt that ἕως and τέως correspond to φάναι
and tdvat respectively. Now as, by tho side of λέως, wo have rata and

λᾶε, so by the side of ἕως we hare ἃς (Pind. Ο. 11. ὄις Aristoph. Lyristr. ,

173), which was also written Ἑᾶς (Τώ. Hercei. 2, 52, p. 207); and re
may therefore inser the intermediats form dloc=dfcd=ydwat A

similar argument may bc deduoed from the genitive in -ευςπεῐοε or -pos
(Now Gratylua, Mle).
