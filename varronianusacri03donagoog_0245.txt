The first remark to be made respecting this inscription is,
thatif we abnuant the forms which are obviously proper mures,

the remaining words present very striking resemblanccs to sig·
nificaut terms in the oldest Teutonis languagcs, and that the
meanings thus assigned are supported hythe groupsinto which
the words naturally fall. Thus we cannot help noticing the
following groups or short clauses which sometimes partially

kei aaut teia* raineri. II. (a) fidlert' terail teti raiae& (0) suile

(d) spel thutai hena. Some oi these collocatione suggest imme·
diately a plausible interpretation. For example, as desen is
“ten'' and dam-das “elenen‘’ in Umbrian (Fabretti, p. 305),
and aa daia is duo in Oscan (Huschke, dic och. ra Tol. Spr.
p. 70), and door is duobus in Umbrian (Fabretti, p. 323), itis
extremely probable that teano is “ten'' (Stickel, das Etruskacte,
p. 30), and if so, acui ter't will be “ twelve,” and we shall have
both numbers together in ll. 23, 24. The probability ot* finding
numerals in the inscription is supported by the phrase XII
nuper, which· may mean “twelve sons.” This being the case,
fidiam, which stands by the side oi atat tetii ratres (4, 5) will
be plural, audsnilc by the side of 00010οα (13) will be singular,
whether the word is or is not to be understood as meaning ‘⁶ de-
sired” or “ lamented,” aster the analogy of the O. N. suas, yfysr'rzn,
“cupidus’' “ aagerly desirous,'’ or as denoting pity lor the dead
after the analogy of O. N. vesal, cael, “ miser‚” “ infelix.” But
although no certain results can be expected from a comparison

- between syllables occurring in this inscription aud others of

similar round, which are found in the Old Norae and other
