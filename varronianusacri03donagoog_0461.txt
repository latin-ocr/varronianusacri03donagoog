a formation of an infinitive appears to me simply impossible3
and as all these infinitives are referred to verbs of the -o
conjugatiou, Ι have no difficulty in explaining these words
in the same way as Ι have explained the agglutinata forms
iu ·esoo‚ -essere (above, ξ 7); and as copes-so = capere-sino,
so apocynon-so = magnove-sino. With regard to the appa-
rently future signification of the infinitives iu -oasere, it is
sufficient to remark that an auxiliary may give this meaning,
as iu the case of diem instituo = dabam, mentioned above
(§ 9); and the future in the Romanoa languages is always
formed by an agglutinato appendage of haheo, as in aur-oi=
ooeroi=hobcre habeo. As firero=fireso and fherim=fiaeaim
oscillate between the forms ero= eoo and aim = caim, the plural
might exhihit a similar freedom of choiee; and fircr'a'mue :fic-
mimos or fue-aimus might represent either erimus, which is
shortened in its penultima, or simne, which has lost its initial
syllable. But authority is in favour of the long t. In the
passive aud deponent verbs the loss of the perfect subjunctive
is supplied by a periphrastic tense made up of the future cro
and the participle in -tua Itis a matter of indifference whether
we refer this tense to a period when the future and present
subjunctive of the substantive verb were still identieal, or
whether we suppose that it is an approximatiou to the Greek
poubpoat-fiatarum, adopted to meet a syntactieal exigency.

ξ 16. The Post Teneo oftlze Infinitive Actius.

The past tense of the infinitive active ends in -iaae, when
it corresponds to the Greek first aorist‚ as scribebas ,· when
it is the regular perfect, aa tempsisse ,- and when it is a com·
posite form, as ama-emmeramme. It is to bc recollected
thatin all these cases the same tense inserts an a=r iu the
second person singular aud second aud third persons plural
of the indicative mood. There can be little doubt that this
doubling of thesin theiufiuitive (sse) is to he explained from
theindicative mood. As we have foi-ath instead of fifteen-tab,
so we have sci-sse instead of fofirsa-oe ,· and in both cases the

additional s is analogous to thatin fecissem = firi-scails, from
