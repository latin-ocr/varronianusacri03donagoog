The infinitivo (c) and the participle (a) are, insuat, different,
or apparently different, applicatione of one and the same form.
In its infinitivo use this verbal in adca is called by two names-
the parandium when it governs the object of the verb, and the
ceramicum when it agrees with the object. Thus, in “con-
silinm capicsde‘ urbem‚’' we have a perandiamr in “consilinm
, urbis capiendoe‚” a perendinam. As participles, the ordinary
grammatical nomenclatura most incorrectly distinguishes the
form in adas as “ a future passive,” from the form ·n[t]r con·
sidered as “a present active.” The form in adas is never a
future, and it bears no resemblance tc the passive in sorra. The
real difficulty is to explain to the student the [seeming alternation
ol an active and passive meaninp in these forms. Perhaps there
isne better way of doing this than by directing attention to the
fact, that the difference between active and passive really be-
comes evanescent in the infinitivo use of a verh “ He is a man
to love '' = “he is a man to be loved ;” “I give you this to eat”
= “I give you this tc be eaten,'’ llic.¹ The Greek active infini-
tives in -pevaa, -ναι, are really passive forms in their inflected
