character oi their writing, in most of their mythology, in by t'ar

the greatest number of those words which have been transmitted ’

to us with an interpretation, and in the oldest inscriptions, espe-
cially in those from Caere, there are decisive evidentes of an
affinity between the inhabitants of Etruria and those Pelasgians
who peopled Greece in the earliest times, and who constituted an
important clement in the inhabitants ot Latium. For the residue
of the langnage, and especially in the case of those inscriptions
which are soundness Clusium and Per-ugia, we are enabled to
recognize an ingredient unmistakably identical with that Scan·
dinavian dialect, which Norwegian emigrante conveyed in an
ancient form to the inaccessible regions of ultima Itala, where
it remained for centurias safe from all risle of conuptiou or im·
provement by an infirsion of foreign words or consuuctions. Now
these phenomena‚ as we have seen, are necessary to reconcile, and
do in fact reconcile, all the traditions about the inhabitants of
Etruria The Pelasgian affinities of theold Tyrrheniam are
attested by the concurring voice of all antiquity; and as in Argo-
lis, so in Italy, we shall best understand the statement that a
more complete civilisation was imported directly from Lydia, if
we bear in mind that the Lydians referred to in the tradition
were Pelasgians, who had appropriated the arts and social culture
of their Asiatic neighbours,‚and with whom the Tyrrheniam oi
Italy came into contaot as navigatore of the Mediterranean. And
wc shall be able to adopt this universal belief of an early con-
nexion or intercourse between the western coasts of Asia Minor
and Italy, without distmbing the well-grounded statement that
the Rasena and Rati were one and the same race, if we infer
that these Rasena were a much later ingredient, and one which
only established an aristocracy of conquest in the citios of
Etruria, without permanently or extensively affecting the· great
massot the population. It will be observed that the main
obstacle to a general reception of the statement that the Rasena
were Raetians has comisted in the apparept inconsistency between
this and the Lydian tradition, a tradition which, as we have seen
(above, p. 20), has no historical basis, and only a certain admix-
ture of ethnical truth. I'hc usual inversion, by which Livy
makes the Raetiam the fugitive offshoot of a nation which really
descended from their own mountains, has not occasioned any
