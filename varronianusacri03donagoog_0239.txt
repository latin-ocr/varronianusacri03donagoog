every reason to expect resemblances between the two languages,
it meamea a matter of importance to inquire whether the gram-
matical identity can be established3 and this amounts to the
proof that lot and tarano are both verba Ol course there is no
palad sooria reason to conclude that taam is a verb. On the
wntrary, Niebuhr (Kaine ababa, 111. p. 40) thinks that thano
is a noun signiiying “a lady,’f and that Tanaquil is ,only a
diminutive ol it; and Passeri, whom hs quotes, suggests that
ὑ stam is a title of honour, nearly equivalent in meaning, though

not of course in origin, to the modern Italian Danao (from ·

domina). Even on the supposition that we have here the same
language ss that of the Runic monuments, it might have oecur-
red to any one to compare wana with tha accusative pronoun
tharra, ss iu 'aia thena (Diaterich, p. 79). Fortunataly, how·
ever, about the time when this comparison between the Runic
aud Etruscan phraseology first occurred to me, my friend, Mr. J.
H. Porteus Oakes, returned from a tour in Italy, and presented
to the Museum at Bury St Edmund's asmall patara or saucer,
which he had obtained at Ohiusi, and which exhibite the follow·
ing legend: sam malaoth asotia This at once furnished me
witlr the means of proving that lot wana in the Perugian In·
scription were two verbs, the latter being au infinitiva and the
former an auxiliary on which it depende. For it is obvious that

. taailoeth is the third person of a transitive verb, the nominative

being Nfhtia, probably the name ol a vomentes. Gaphatrbl=
Oafaa'o achra in Dennis’s bilingual inscription, 11. p. 475), and
the accusative being stam sor amm, Umbr. ast- (cf. mi with
amr} sae). The verb lenibat manifestly belongs to the same
class of forms as the agglutinato or weak-perseots in Gothic,
which are formed by the affix of the causative do, as sokida,
‘.‘I did seelr” (Gabelenta u. Labe, Goth. (ironam. ξ127). We
have this Gothic formation in the Latin aaa-do, pan-do, &c.; and
I have discussed in a subsequent chapter the remarkable caum·
tiras in -ao, -sioi, as orcasoo, capa-so, quoa-so, &a It is clear
then that lat taam represents as separate words what antbert
exhibita in an agglutinato form. In the latter ease the auxiliary
isin· the present tense, which in Gothicis formed in th,· and
lot is a strong perfect. There is no difficulty about the meaning
of wana, tani, which arc clearly identieal with the Icelandic
