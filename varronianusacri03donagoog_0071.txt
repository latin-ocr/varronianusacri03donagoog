applied to the‘ worship of their own Apollo, were a festival of
Achaean or Pelasgiau origin, and symbolically expressed the
triumph ol the sun’s disk over the rainy months of winter¹. All
the Pelasgian religion, wherever it can be discerned under tha
incrustations of later Hellenism, points to the sama worship of the
sun. Jupiter and Danae, of whose uniou the Argiva Perseus '
was the fruit, represent the golden showers of the fructifying
sky deseending on the dry earth (δανάη W. The Argive
goddess Juno is called βοῶπις, aa being a representative of the
moon-goddess, who bora her dish between two horus, and who
is thus identified with Io, “the earth,” the daughter of Inachus³.
In tha sams way Europa, the “broad-faeed” moon, is borne¹
across the sea from east to west by Jupiter in the form of a bull,
that is, tha sun in Taurus in conjunctior with the moon rises
from thessalam waves. Here shc assumes the iunctione of
Ἄρτεμις ταυροπόλος, and, as we shall see, Artemo, which, in
the Pelasgian language, was Ari-times, and means “the virgin
of the sea,” becomes ideutical with Ἀρέ-θουσα, “the virgin
swiftly moving⁴,” for the idea ostime finds oue of its natural
expressions in that ol flowing water⁵. Even the name κύκλωψ,
which has furnished a designation for the peculiar architectura
of tha Pelasgians, must refer to figures adorned with the sun's
dish, rather than to any monophthalmis symbols3 aud we shall
see. the same transition iu the earliest seats of the Pelasgia
race‘. The connexion of the Pelasgi with the Sclavonians,
which will clearly appear in the sequel, brings tham into close
conmct also with the early Celtic tribes. Now there can ba
hardly any doubt that the circular and megalithic structuras,-
which are found in Britain aud elsewhere, belong to the ele-
mentary worship of the early Oelts. These buildings, whether
grown in· trees, as a grove, or built up in massive stores, repre-
sented the world3 and this is the true interpretation of Arthur’s
Round Table. It was “made hy Merlin for a type of the,
