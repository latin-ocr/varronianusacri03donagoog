this idiom· The details ol this subject helong to afutura chap-

tar. Itis sufficient to mention in this place that the Etruscan
language, as exhibited in the fragments which have acme down
to us, consiste of three separate or separable elementa. We have
either worda which admit of a direct eomparieon with Greek and
latin, aud these we will ealltheTyrrheuo-Pelasgian clementes
the lauguage3 or words which present affinities to the Umbriau
and Oscau dialects; or words which resemble neither of the
other, but may be explained by the Gothic affinities, which, for
other reasons, we should be led ta seelr in the language of the
Batiana. The first clement appears most in the words quoted
with an explanation by Roman writers, that is, in words ol the
southern Etruscaus, who were to the last the purast representa·
ti'ves of the Tyrrheno-Belasgiaus. We find the same kind of
words iu inscriptions from the same dishiet. On the other haud,
in the great eities ol northern Etruria, and especially iu the high-
lauds of Umbria, we either find a mixed idiom, or must seelr our
explanatione from the Gothic idioma to which Ι have referred.
If the Etruscaus, properly so called, did not establish themselves
permanently or iu very great numbers much to the south of
Volsinii, and if in all their conquesta to the south-west of their
territory they rather occupied the cities than peopled the lidda,-
and both these facts appear ou the face of their history,·-it will
follow that the περίοικοι in south Etruria, as in Laconia after
the Dorian invasion, aad in Iln'gland after the Normau conquest,
would retain their original, that is, their Tyrrheno-Pelasgian
'dialect This result is illustrated by two incidente to which Lep-
sios has referred with a somewhat different objeet¹. Livy tells u's
(a 4), thatin the year 301 rac. the legate Gn. Fulvius, serving
in Etruria, escaped au ambush aud detected some pretended
chepherds who would have led him into it, by learning from the
men of Gaere who acted as his interpretare, that the shepherds
spoke the town lauguage, not that of the country, aud that their
outward appearance did not correspond to that of rustica. The
same author informa us (1x. 36), thatin the year 308 ac. a
Roman nobleman and his slave, who had learned Etruscan at Caere,
travelled through the Ciminiau forest and as lar aa the Camertes .
