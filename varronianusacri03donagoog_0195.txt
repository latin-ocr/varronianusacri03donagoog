supply us also with a very important fact in regard to the Etrus·
ean syllabarium: namely, that their liquida were really semi-
vowels3 iu other words, that these letters did not require the
expression of an articulatim-vowel. It has been shown elee-
where¹ that the semi-vocal nenne of the liquid is indicated in
most langnagea bytho etymological fact, that it may he articu-
lated by a vowel either preceding or following it. For example:
mute ψ liquid ψ vowel = mute ÷ vowel ι liquid, is an equation
which holds good in every etymologieal problem. Applying this
principle to the Etruscan transcriptions‚ we see that the Etrus·
een Ap[u]lu, Aehfflla, Aa[a]lncnt, Eremia El[e]chs[e]ntre‚
dsen[a]la, M[e]n[e]rva,1³tcl[c]nicn, Ur[e]ete, dre. are represen-
tatives of the Greek Ἀπόλλων, Ἀχιλλεύς, Ἀταλάντη, Ἡρακλῆς,
Ἀλέξανδρος, Μενελέως, Πολυνείκης, Ὀρέστης, and of the Latin
llinerva, only because the Etruscans did not find it necessary
to express in writing the articulation·vowe1s of the liquide. It is
interesting to remark that the old poetic dialect of the Ioelandic‚
as distinguished from the modern tongue, exhibite the same pecu-
liarity; thus ι· is always written for ar, as in anthr, veihs, akr,
ectr, eitr. 'l'here are afew instances of the same brachygraphy
in the oldest Greek inscriptions: thus, on Mr. Burgon‘s vase we
hare ΑΘΗΝΗΘΝ for Ἀθήνηθεν. Bockh (O. Ι. Νο. 33) hae
wrongly read this inscription, which forms three cretica: τῶν
ἈθὴΙνηθεν didiae ἐμέ. With regard to the form noa, for
which we have Hercola in Dempster, T. 1. Tab. V1.; Lauzi, 11.
