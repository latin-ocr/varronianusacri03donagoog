mentor* the second end third elemento, which is found iu the

may he extended by successive accretions to a considerable

vehicle of ulterior formations3 and, for the same resson, all pro-

nominal elements, which might he mistahen for person-endings γ

It is not always possible to assign a definite meaning to ull
the clemente or combinatione of clemente, which contributc to

the extension of the crude form in Latin nonns3 but so fer as we l
ceu errive et the signification of the affin, we can see that the ¹
distinctiva use of the pronouns is preserved iu this application; Ἴ
nemely, thet the first pronominsl clement expresses that the ¹

thing proceeds from, or immediately belongs to, the subeon the

second, thet it has a relation to tlte mipene· the third, that itis =
e mere effect, or something removed from the proximity of the 2

subject. We also observe thet the' combinatione of these ele· ¹
ments are reguleted by the seme principle as that which explains ,

their use in prepositions and other independent words; namely,
“that if any one oi the clemente of positionis combined with
-να, en ultimate form of the third clement, it indicates motion aud
continentior iu a direction of which the clement in question

represents the point nearest to the subject; and that hy sub- κ
joining eny oue of the pronominel clemente to any other of i
them, we denote a motion or continuation from the position ἒ

signified by the first clement towards that indicated by the
second, eud so on, is the combination involves more then two.'¹
